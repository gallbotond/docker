128
00:04:54,471 --> 00:04:57,240

threw a mountain of money

at new surgical equipment.

130
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:00,611
Then you opened up
the residency program

131
00:05:00,644 --> 00:05:03,113
six months
before you should have.

132
00:05:03,146 --> 00:05:07,117
You made a residency class
from the bottom of the barrel--

133
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,385
the rejects.

134
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:10,220
Yeah, that smacks
of desperation.

135
00:05:10,253 --> 00:05:12,222
I will not cosign.

136
00:05:12,255 --> 00:05:14,525
Well, look, they are
an excellent group, Bailey.

137
00:05:14,558 --> 00:05:16,827
They are a carefully
cultivated group.

138
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,829
We got hundreds
of applications,

139
00:05:18,862 --> 00:05:21,197
and we combed through them
to find the gems.

140
00:05:21,231 --> 00:05:25,168
This class-- they may not have
gotten straight A's like you,

141
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:27,438
but they have stories
and they have heart.

142
00:05:27,471 --> 00:05:29,039
They have empathy.

143
00:05:29,072 --> 00:05:32,175
And when you're trying to build
a solid surgeon,

144
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,810
that counts for a lot.

145
00:05:33,844 --> 00:05:37,981
And I would highly recommend
gallivanting around the world.

146
00:05:38,014 --> 00:05:39,783
It changes your thinking.

147
00:05:39,816 --> 00:05:42,786
It just-- It opens up your--
your mind.

148
00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:44,455
You're telling me
I'm closed-minded?

149
00:05:44,488 --> 00:05:46,289
I-I did no such thing.

00:05:46,322 --> 00:05:48,024
Dr. Webber!

151
00:05:48,058 --> 00:05:50,661
I promised Jo Wilson that if she
got me a spot in OB-GYN,

152
00:05:50,694 --> 00:05:52,529
I would see
the residency through,

153
00:05:52,563 --> 00:05:55,231
no matter when the surgery
program opened back up.

154
00:05:55,265 --> 00:05:58,001
So, presently,
I'm risking not only my job,

155
00:05:58,034 --> 00:05:59,670
but also my friendship.

156
00:05:59,703 --> 00:06:02,272
That being said, I hate it.

157
00:06:02,305 --> 00:06:03,674
I hate it so much.

158
00:06:03,707 --> 00:06:06,577
You need
senior surgical residents.

159
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:10,246
I-- I might so far as to say
you need a Chief Resident.

160
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,116
And if you make me him,
I will be mean.

161
00:06:13,149 --> 00:06:15,018
I will be bossy.

162
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:16,687
And if I'm ever tempted
to go soft,

163
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,124
I will picture a return to OB,
and I will get stronger.

164
00:06:21,157 --> 00:06:24,728

which I've been forced to learn

165
00:06:24,761 --> 00:06:28,131

its natural size

166
00:06:28,164 --> 00:06:31,001
and lift a 30 pound weight
just by flexing.

167
00:06:32,202 --> 00:06:34,170

168

if you'd let me.

169
00:06:37,974 --> 00:06:43,614
Or, um, you might, um,
prefer the term backbone, sir.

170
00:06:43,647 --> 00:06:45,849
I wish you all
the best of luck.

171
00:06:50,053 --> 00:06:52,856
You'll need to speak
to Chief Grey, Schmitt.

172
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:55,926
And, um,
I would suggest you...

173
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:58,061
modify the--
the speech there.

174
00:06:59,295 --> 00:07:01,598

175

00:07:03,366 --> 00:07:06,002
The bus flipped over and landed
after a 20-foot drop,

177
00:07:06,036 --> 00:07:07,103
and because
many of the passengers

178
00:07:07,137 --> 00:07:08,505
were not wearing seatbelts,

179
00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:10,306
we have an inordinate number
of patients

180
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,743
who may have experienced
catastrophic brain injury.

181
00:07:12,776 --> 00:07:14,511
How do we declare
brain death?

182
00:07:14,545 --> 00:07:15,812
Dr. Kwan.

183
00:07:15,846 --> 00:07:17,113
Numerous criteria
must be met

184
00:07:17,147 --> 00:07:18,582
before determination
of brain death,

185
00:07:18,615 --> 00:07:20,316
including at least
two clinical exams

186
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,352
and a confirmatory test
such as a brain scan.

187
00:07:22,385 --> 00:07:24,154
Correct.
How many are there?

188
00:07:24,187 --> 00:07:25,989
We raise our hands and we wait
to be called on, Dr. Adams.

189
00:07:26,022 --> 00:07:27,958
It may seem infantilizing,
but it maintains

190
00:07:27,991 --> 00:07:31,828
a necessary pecking order
that keeps people alive.

191
00:07:31,862 --> 00:07:33,096
Dr. Adams.

192
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:34,598
How many are potentially
brain-dead?

193
00:07:34,631 --> 00:07:36,399
14.
Whoa.

194
00:07:36,432 --> 00:07:38,068
Well, how many are donors?

195
00:07:40,971 --> 00:07:42,405
Dr. Griffith.
How many of those 14

196
00:07:42,438 --> 00:07:43,774
are potential organ donors?

197
00:07:43,807 --> 00:07:47,243
Nine.
Whoa. Organpalooza.

198
00:07:47,277 --> 00:07:49,613
I can't overstate
how inappropriate that is.

199
00:07:49,646 --> 00:07:50,981
I have a dark sense
of humor.

200
00:07:51,014 --> 00:07:52,482
You don't get to talk
for the rest of the day.

201
00:07:52,515 --> 00:07:53,917
I was just--
I mean it.

202
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,952
Every one of those organs
came from a person

203
00:07:55,986 --> 00:07:57,654
who was living
their life yesterday.

204
00:07:57,688 --> 00:08:00,090
A person with family and friends
who are devastated today

205
00:08:00,123 --> 00:08:01,357
and praying
for a miracle.

206
00:08:01,391 --> 00:08:02,759
I'm so sorry. I--
Don't be sorry.

207
00:08:02,793 --> 00:08:04,360
Just don't talk.

208
00:08:07,197 --> 00:08:09,733
We'll ask the families to move
to the waiting room

209
00:08:09,766 --> 00:08:11,401
while we run
confirmatory tests.

210
00:08:11,434 --> 00:08:13,570
We have already alerted
the OPO for potential donors.

211
00:08:13,604 --> 00:08:15,471
We have transplant surgeons
on standby

212
00:08:15,505 --> 00:08:17,073
from all over the country
to make sure

213
00:08:17,107 --> 00:08:20,877
that not one precious,
life-giving organ goes to waste.

214
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,062

I recognized you
from that article you wrote

266
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:53,163
about racial disparities in
outcomes after bypass surgery. Yes.

267
00:10:53,196 --> 00:10:55,598

You are brilliant. Oh.

Dr. Millin,
are you just fangirling

275
00:11:09,813 --> 00:11:10,781
or did you come here
to tell her something?

276

Oh, sorry. Yes.

277
00:11:12,582 --> 00:11:15,385

Winston, will you--
Yeah, I'll-- I'll--

283
00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:24,494
I'll start the paperwork. Yeah.

284
00:11:24,527 --> 00:11:25,728

can I please join you?

287
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:30,967
I just had to tell a family
the worst news of their life,

288
00:11:31,001 --> 00:11:33,169
and I could really use
some of the opposite.

289
00:11:37,373 --> 00:11:40,276
Ms. Milton, I'm Dr. Yasuda.

290
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,445
Your daughter Marina
is showing distinct signs

291
00:11:42,478 --> 00:11:43,947
of brain activity.

292
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,616
Her eyes are fixating
on stationary objects.

293
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:50,620
But-- But I saw everyone.

294
00:11:50,653 --> 00:11:53,289
I saw all the other parents.

295
00:11:53,323 --> 00:11:55,959
You're-- You're saying
there's a chance she might live?

296
00:11:56,893 --> 00:11:58,294
She might live through this?

297
00:11:58,328 --> 00:11:59,662
We're continuing
to make adjustments

298
00:11:59,695 --> 00:12:01,832
to her ventilator
and her medications

299
00:12:01,865 --> 00:12:04,334
and hoping
the brain swelling comes down.

300
00:12:05,435 --> 00:12:09,205
And, yes, there is a chance
that she might live.

301
00:12:11,574 --> 00:12:14,510
I'm...

302
00:12:14,544 --> 00:12:16,246
too afraid to hope.

303
00:12:21,451 --> 00:12:23,286
Okay.

304
00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:25,255
I get that.

305
00:12:25,288 --> 00:12:27,858
How about if I hope for you?

306
00:12:27,891 --> 00:12:30,861
I have seven sisters, and one
of them is around Marina's age.

307
00:12:30,894 --> 00:12:33,729
So I will hope for Marina

308
00:12:33,763 --> 00:12:35,265
the way I would hope
for my own sister.

309
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,870
Um, I'll keep you posted.

310
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:48,879
Don't mind him.
He's a cry baby.

311
00:12:48,912 --> 00:12:50,213
I am.

312
00:12:50,246 --> 00:12:53,583
It's okay.
I'm emotional, too.

313
00:12:53,616 --> 00:12:56,186
You've waited so long
for this, Howard.

314
00:12:56,219 --> 00:12:59,689
I honestly didn't think
this day would come.

315
00:12:59,722 --> 00:13:01,057
Dr. Millin,
why don't you check

316
00:13:01,091 --> 00:13:02,392
Howard's blood pressure
while we're here?

317
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:05,962
What is it--
bring your kid to work day?

318
00:13:05,996 --> 00:13:08,764
Our surgical residency program
just opened back up today,

319
00:13:08,798 --> 00:13:10,600
so we finally
have interns again.

320
00:13:10,633 --> 00:13:11,902
You look 12.
Are you 12?

321
00:13:11,935 --> 00:13:12,903
Uh, no, sir.

322
00:13:12,936 --> 00:13:14,604
We're just old, babe.

323
00:13:14,637 --> 00:13:17,107
We're so old that the young
adults look like children.

324
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,109
And now you'll get to grow
even older together.

325
00:13:21,444 --> 00:13:23,279
Oh, no.

326
00:13:23,313 --> 00:13:25,581
He had just stopped. Sorry.

327
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,920
Yay! They're here!

328
00:13:29,953 --> 00:13:32,088
The black scrubs
are here!

329
00:13:32,122 --> 00:13:33,256
Who are the black scrubs
for?

330
00:13:33,289 --> 00:13:35,591
Uh, for me, for OB.

331
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:38,528
The female body has become
a war zone in this country,

332
00:13:38,561 --> 00:13:41,364
and pink
is a peacetime color.

333
00:13:41,397 --> 00:13:42,765
Got it.
So it's a statement.

334
00:13:42,798 --> 00:13:45,135
No, it's more
a state of mind. Yeah.

335
00:13:45,168 --> 00:13:46,336
Need some help?

336
00:13:46,369 --> 00:13:47,971
I'm good. You?

337
00:13:48,004 --> 00:13:49,839
Actually, yeah, I do.

338
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:53,977
Um, do you remember that girl
from Saturday night?

339
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:56,312
Um, the blonde?

340
00:13:56,346 --> 00:13:57,347
No, that was Thursday.

341
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,115
Oh, um...
Oh, oh, yeah!

342
00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:00,583
The one that kind of looks
like the Snow White

343
00:14:00,616 --> 00:14:02,152
to your Prince Charming?
Yeah.

344
00:14:02,185 --> 00:14:05,055
And she had a Disney princessy
kind of name.

345
00:14:05,088 --> 00:14:06,389
Jules.
Yes!

346
00:14:06,422 --> 00:14:08,191
Yeah. Turns out
she works here now.

347
00:14:09,859 --> 00:14:11,061
Doing what?

348
00:14:12,462 --> 00:14:13,729
Surgical intern.

349
00:14:13,763 --> 00:14:16,732
Oh, my God!

350
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,202
I'm-- I'm fired, right?

351
00:14:19,235 --> 00:14:20,736
I should just go
pack my things?

352
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:23,339
You didn't know when you
brought her into our home

353
00:14:23,373 --> 00:14:24,975
that she was
an incoming resident?

354
00:14:25,008 --> 00:14:27,377
Well, there were drinks.
The bar was loud.

355
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,512
She might have said it,
and I might have nodded

356
00:14:29,545 --> 00:14:32,582
like I heard it.
With your old man ears?

357
00:14:32,615 --> 00:14:34,650
That hurts. Okay,
so what am I supposed to do?

358
00:14:34,684 --> 00:14:37,820
Get ahead of it.
Talk to the chief.

359
00:14:37,853 --> 00:14:39,522
Woman on P.A.:
<i>Dr. Coen to PEDs ICU.</i>

360
00:14:39,555 --> 00:14:43,026
<i>Dr. Coen, report to PEDs ICU, please.</i>

361
00:14:43,059 --> 00:14:44,594
Oh, hey, man. Hey.

362
00:14:44,627 --> 00:14:46,162
- Hey.
- How you doing?

363
00:14:46,196 --> 00:14:47,830
Good.
Good, good, good.

364
00:14:49,966 --> 00:14:51,701
Hell of a day, man.

365
00:14:51,734 --> 00:14:53,136
Yeah, yeah.

366
00:14:54,504 --> 00:14:56,639
It's been a while
since I've seen you.

367
00:14:56,672 --> 00:14:57,640
Yeah.

368
00:14:57,673 --> 00:14:58,808
What do we do now?

369
00:15:01,177 --> 00:15:03,079
Dr. Ndugu,
may I join you?

370
00:15:03,113 --> 00:15:04,780
I would love to see
what's involved with procuring

371
00:15:04,814 --> 00:15:06,316
an organ
for a transplant.

372
00:15:06,349 --> 00:15:07,550
Yeah,
I guess that's fine.

373
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,019
Yeah.
What, me too?

374
00:15:10,253 --> 00:15:12,122
O-Okay. Yeah.

375
00:15:16,126 --> 00:15:18,061
Man, I've never seen
a line like this.

376
00:15:18,094 --> 00:15:19,729
Yeah, it's pretty crazy.

377
00:15:19,762 --> 00:15:21,998
I've never heard of eight donors
in one hospital in one day.

378
00:15:22,032 --> 00:15:24,567
Freak storm, you know?
Terrible day.

379
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,203
40 lives.
You said what?

380
00:15:27,237 --> 00:15:29,405
It's the worst math.
It's transplant surgeon math.

381
00:15:29,439 --> 00:15:32,375
We do it to comfort ourselves.

382
00:15:32,408 --> 00:15:34,577
8 deaths
saves up to 40 lives,

383
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,379
and that's not including
skin and corneas.

384
00:15:36,412 --> 00:15:39,915
So, yes, it is a horrible day,
but it is also a beautiful day,

385
00:15:39,949 --> 00:15:41,617
and it all coexists.

386
00:15:41,651 --> 00:15:43,219
That is
a little comforting.

387
00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:51,594
So how's everything been here,
uh, since the shut down?

388
00:15:51,627 --> 00:15:53,963
Honestly, man,
it's been awful.

389
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:56,432
I mean, a teaching hospital
with no residents?

390
00:15:56,466 --> 00:15:58,234
You know who ends up
with all the scut?

391
00:15:58,268 --> 00:15:59,602
The junior attending. Mm.

392
00:15:59,635 --> 00:16:01,471
You know who ends up
holding the clamps?

393
00:16:01,504 --> 00:16:03,206
The junior attending.

394
00:16:03,239 --> 00:16:05,608
And you know when that starts
to feel like hell?

395
00:16:05,641 --> 00:16:07,510
When the woman you love
is your boss.

396
00:16:07,543 --> 00:16:10,513
So it's been rough.

397
00:16:10,546 --> 00:16:14,117
I honestly just think I was
asking how Meredith's been.

398
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:17,287
Oh. Oh, yeah.
Okay. Um, good.

399
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,322
She's a--
She's a good chief.

400
00:16:19,355 --> 00:16:21,457
So she made that job official,
did she?

401
00:16:21,491 --> 00:16:23,126
Her title is interim chief,

402
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:26,062
but, you know, six months in,
feels pretty official.

403
00:16:26,096 --> 00:16:27,730
Got it. Yeah.

404
00:16:35,705 --> 00:16:36,939
Yeah.

405
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,510
I do, I understand.

406
00:16:40,543 --> 00:16:43,012
It's just my patient has been
waiting longer,

407
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:46,216
and her cardiac and liver
function are deteriorating fast.

408
00:16:46,249 --> 00:16:48,184
Also, the donor is
in this hospital.

409
00:16:48,218 --> 00:16:49,652
Yes, I will hold.

410
00:16:49,685 --> 00:16:52,622
Um, I need you alone.
Link was here first.

411
00:16:52,655 --> 00:16:56,226
Oh, uh, yeah,
I-- I just...

412
00:16:57,993 --> 00:16:59,795
I slept with an intern.

413
00:16:59,829 --> 00:17:01,063
But I didn't know
she was an intern.

414
00:17:01,097 --> 00:17:03,899
It was-- It was before.
It was not today.

415
00:17:03,933 --> 00:17:06,569
It was...
Wow. This is awkward. Um...

416
00:17:06,602 --> 00:17:09,004
I'm in no position
to judge you on this.

417
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:11,006
I do recommend you stay away
from elevators

418
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,209
for the foreseeable future.

419
00:17:13,243 --> 00:17:17,046
Go to HR. They have paperwork
for this kind of thing.

420
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,181
Thank you. Mm.

421
00:17:18,214 --> 00:17:19,849
Good luck.

422
00:17:22,718 --> 00:17:24,254
Nick's here.

423
00:17:24,287 --> 00:17:26,122
He's here.

424
00:17:26,156 --> 00:17:27,423
Nick Marsh!

425
00:17:27,457 --> 00:17:29,592
Don't try to be calm,
and don't try to be chiefly.

426
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,060
The man you love is here,

427
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:32,728
waiting for an organ
in the surgical corridor.

428
00:17:32,762 --> 00:17:34,864
Of course he is.
Half the transplant surgeons

429
00:17:34,897 --> 00:17:36,199
in the country are here.

430
00:17:36,232 --> 00:17:37,433
Well, then go talk to him, Meredith.

431
00:17:37,467 --> 00:17:38,934
I'm on the phone
with UNOS.

432
00:17:38,968 --> 00:17:40,736
There's a triple organ match
for Sarah Martinez.

433
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,572
They're saying someone's
in line ahead of her.

434
00:17:42,605 --> 00:17:47,177
Meredith, you have been sad
for six months.

435
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:48,844
Even Zola has noticed.

436
00:17:48,878 --> 00:17:50,346
Last week, she asked me
for Nick's phone number

437
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,248
so that she could call him
and explain to him

438
00:17:52,282 --> 00:17:53,949
why you never
went to Minnesota

439
00:17:53,983 --> 00:17:56,519
and that maybe he would
understand and come and visit.

440
00:17:56,552 --> 00:17:58,788
And now he's here.

441
00:17:58,821 --> 00:18:01,056
And you love him.

442
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,625
Don't be an idiot.

443
00:18:02,658 --> 00:18:04,594
You never told me
that story.

444
00:18:04,627 --> 00:18:07,630
Yes, I'm here.
Yes! Thank you so much.

445
00:18:07,663 --> 00:18:09,131
Thank you.
Dr. Grey.

446
00:18:09,165 --> 00:18:10,700
Um, sorry to interrupt. Yes.

447
00:18:10,733 --> 00:18:12,935
Uh, I have carefully considered,
and I feel...

448
00:18:14,304 --> 00:18:16,172
You hate OB.
More than I hate war.

449
00:18:16,206 --> 00:18:18,408
You'd make a good
chief resident.

450
00:18:18,441 --> 00:18:20,109
Seriously?

451
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:30,653
Hi.
Hello.

452
00:18:33,623 --> 00:18:35,157
Dr. Adams.

453
00:18:35,191 --> 00:18:36,826
Did you bring the patient
down-- Liam Collins?

454
00:18:36,859 --> 00:18:39,462
Yes, Chief.
They're prepping him now.

455
00:18:43,132 --> 00:18:44,934
Dr. Marsh?
Mm-hmm?

456
00:18:44,967 --> 00:18:46,502
I just got off the phone
with UNOS.
Uh-huh.

457
00:18:46,536 --> 00:18:49,004
I have a triple organ transplant
match for my patient,

458
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:50,573
Sarah Martinez.

459
00:18:50,606 --> 00:18:52,275
It's the first day
of the new residency program,

460
00:18:52,308 --> 00:18:56,111
and I can't really disappear
into an OR for 25 hours.

461
00:18:56,145 --> 00:18:59,282
So if you'd be willing
to take point on this,

462
00:18:59,315 --> 00:19:02,418
then I can find someone
to transport your organ

463
00:19:02,452 --> 00:19:04,019
back to Minnesota?

464
00:19:06,389 --> 00:19:08,924
A triple organ transplant,
that's what we're talking about?

465
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,593
Those are super rare, yeah?

466
00:19:13,396 --> 00:19:16,666
Uh, ok--
Um, do you feel comfortable

467
00:19:16,699 --> 00:19:18,368
taking the liver
back to Minnesota?

468
00:19:18,401 --> 00:19:20,503
It's for Chen. It's his patient.
He's doing the transplant.

469
00:19:20,536 --> 00:19:23,473
No problem. Okay.

470
00:19:23,506 --> 00:19:25,140
I will scrub in.

471
00:19:25,174 --> 00:19:28,978
Great.
This is... very helpful.

472
00:19:29,011 --> 00:19:30,746
Good.
Shall we go and meet

473
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,483
Sarah Martinez and her family
and deliver the good news?

474
00:19:33,516 --> 00:19:35,050
Let's do it. Okay.

475
00:19:35,084 --> 00:19:37,553
Dr. Ndugu.
Dr. Grey.

476
00:19:40,423 --> 00:19:42,057
That is not how I thought
that would go.

477
00:19:42,091 --> 00:19:43,759
No.

478
00:19:43,793 --> 00:19:46,729
Who has patient number 35467,
Liam Collins?

479
00:19:46,762 --> 00:19:47,997
Oh, that's me.
Or, um...

480
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,499
I just sent him off
to pre-op.

481
00:19:49,532 --> 00:19:50,766
Why didn't you talk
to his family?
I did.

482
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,568
You didn't.
His mom is in the ICU,

483
00:19:52,602 --> 00:19:54,069
screaming
at Dr. Shepherd.

484
00:19:54,103 --> 00:19:55,571
What? No, I--

485
00:19:55,605 --> 00:19:58,173
Okay, I know I definitely spoke
to somebody's mother.

486
00:19:58,207 --> 00:19:59,509
Congratulations
on your first day...

487
00:19:59,542 --> 00:20:00,676
I--

488
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:02,845
...and also your last.

489
00:20:02,878 --> 00:20:04,480
Gotta be some sort of record, right?

490
00:20:11,821 --> 00:20:12,888
I really am so sorry.
I don't know how this happened,

491
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:15,891
but I w-- I will--
You will what?

492
00:20:15,925 --> 00:20:17,327
What can you possibly do
to fix this?

493
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,429
Mrs. Collins,
I know that you have suffered

494
00:20:19,462 --> 00:20:21,564
the worst loss
of your life today,

495
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:25,000
and my intern made
a terrible mistake

496
00:20:25,034 --> 00:20:26,602
in speaking
to the wrong parent,

497
00:20:26,636 --> 00:20:29,472
but I did do the final
round of tests on your son.

498
00:20:29,505 --> 00:20:31,173
I did declare him
brain-dead.

499
00:20:31,206 --> 00:20:32,975
How am I supposed
to trust you?

500
00:20:33,008 --> 00:20:36,211
I wasn't given the chance to say
goodbye to my child.

501
00:20:36,245 --> 00:20:37,713
How am I supposed
to trust your tests

502
00:20:37,747 --> 00:20:39,181
when you and your staff
are capable

503
00:20:39,214 --> 00:20:41,050
of making this kind
of mistake?!

504
00:20:43,218 --> 00:20:45,421
Oh, my sweetheart. Okay.

505
00:20:45,455 --> 00:20:46,656
Oh, my sweet love.

506
00:20:47,923 --> 00:20:49,559
Ma'am, I am so sorry.

507
00:20:49,592 --> 00:20:51,561
Mrs. Collins, uh,
would you like me

508
00:20:51,594 --> 00:20:53,228
to run
the last test again?

509
00:20:53,262 --> 00:20:56,632
I would like you to run
<i>all</i> the tests again.

510
00:20:58,233 --> 00:21:01,471
This is Dr. Grey's
triple organ match.

511
00:21:01,504 --> 00:21:04,239
Then you had better
go talk to Dr. Grey.

512
00:21:07,843 --> 00:21:09,479
Go with him, please.

513
00:21:09,512 --> 00:21:11,481
Make sure he doesn't
screw this up, too.

514
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:18,320
Group hug!

515
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:22,157
Everyone joins.

516
00:21:22,191 --> 00:21:23,993
Oh, everyone join.

517
00:21:24,026 --> 00:21:25,561
I don't know who you are,

518
00:21:25,595 --> 00:21:27,129
but those
are the rules of group hug.

519
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:29,098
Davis, you're embarrassing yourself.

520
00:21:29,131 --> 00:21:31,333
I can live with that.
And it's all three organs?

521
00:21:31,367 --> 00:21:32,802
She's getting
all three of them?

522
00:21:32,835 --> 00:21:34,236
Today?
Yes.

523
00:21:34,269 --> 00:21:35,805
Well, if you don't crush
her surgeons first.

524
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:38,240
Oh, jeez.

525
00:21:38,273 --> 00:21:39,942
Oh.

526
00:21:41,911 --> 00:21:44,079
Say it again. I want
to make sure I understand.

527
00:21:44,113 --> 00:21:46,315
I spoke with the wrong family,
and so Liam's mom

528
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:47,817
almost didn't get
a chance to say goodbye.

529
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,552
And so she's--
she's upset.

530
00:21:49,585 --> 00:21:52,287
I'm sure "upset"
doesn't begin to cover

531
00:21:52,321 --> 00:21:53,789
how that woman feels
right now.

532
00:21:53,823 --> 00:21:55,725
Okay. Is she saying
goodbye to him now?

533
00:21:55,758 --> 00:21:57,292
No.
No?

534
00:21:58,293 --> 00:22:00,563
I need more, Adams.
Uh, I-I'm sorry.

535
00:22:00,596 --> 00:22:02,998
I'm-- I'm so sorry.
Dr. Adams,
save your shame

536
00:22:03,032 --> 00:22:04,534
for after your shift.

537
00:22:04,567 --> 00:22:05,868
Your shame spiral is about you,
and right now,

538
00:22:05,901 --> 00:22:07,870
we need it to be
all about our patients.

539
00:22:07,903 --> 00:22:09,605
You understand?
Griffith?

540
00:22:09,639 --> 00:22:12,341
The mom asked Dr. Shepherd
to run all of the tests again.

541
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:13,976
Is she doing that?
It felt like if she didn't,

542
00:22:14,009 --> 00:22:15,478
the organs would not
be donated.

543
00:22:15,511 --> 00:22:17,012
Okay,
what's the patient's status?

544
00:22:17,046 --> 00:22:18,781
He's brain-dead.

545
00:22:18,814 --> 00:22:21,484
I-- Yes, I understand that,
but were his vitals stable?

546
00:22:21,517 --> 00:22:23,486
Do you understand
why he's asking that?

547
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:25,955
He's asking you that because
if the patient codes--

548
00:22:25,988 --> 00:22:27,890
if the patient's heart stops

549
00:22:27,923 --> 00:22:30,192
before Dr. Shepherd's
finished running the tests,

550
00:22:30,225 --> 00:22:31,727
then you get to be
the one who goes in

551
00:22:31,761 --> 00:22:34,063
and tells that family that
their one-in-a-million match

552
00:22:34,096 --> 00:22:37,032
just got wasted
because of your error.

553
00:22:37,066 --> 00:22:38,534
Stop looking at me
like that.

554
00:22:38,568 --> 00:22:40,235
Go help Dr. Shepherd!

555
00:22:51,747 --> 00:22:54,283
Mrs. Collins
has her family doctor here now,

556
00:22:54,316 --> 00:22:55,951
and she wants him
to sign off on the tests.

557
00:22:55,985 --> 00:22:58,521
She does not trust us
as far as she can kick us,

558
00:22:58,554 --> 00:23:00,956
and I cannot blame her.

559
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:02,758
Dr. Griffith.
I'll go get him.

560
00:23:02,792 --> 00:23:04,760
Mm-hmm.

561
00:23:04,794 --> 00:23:06,395
They had the same name.

562
00:23:06,428 --> 00:23:08,063
And Mrs. Collins,
her first name is Jane,

563
00:23:08,097 --> 00:23:09,632
and I said,
"Are you Jane?"

564
00:23:09,665 --> 00:23:10,966
And the other lady,
she said yes,

565
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,469
and I guess
they had the same name.

566
00:23:13,503 --> 00:23:14,870
You used the first name.

567
00:23:14,904 --> 00:23:16,572
Well, I was trying to be
more personal

568
00:23:16,606 --> 00:23:18,708
because I was about to tell her
her son was brain-dead.

569
00:23:18,741 --> 00:23:22,277
Yeah, but you can see now
why we don't do that.

570
00:23:22,311 --> 00:23:23,345
Yes.

571
00:23:24,547 --> 00:23:27,382
Meanwhile,
who did you talk to?

572
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:29,284
Is there someone named Jane
walking around now who--

573
00:23:29,318 --> 00:23:30,853
who thinks that her child
is brain-dead...

574
00:23:30,886 --> 00:23:32,221
No, no.
...and he isn't?

575
00:23:32,254 --> 00:23:34,557
No. I checked.
Her name is Jane Miller

576
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,926
and her son <i>is</i> brain-dead...
too.

577
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:39,428
Mrs. Collins?
Dr. Shepherd sent me.

578
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:41,897
This is our family doctor,
Dr. Shagrin.

579
00:23:41,931 --> 00:23:43,799
Dr. Shagrin,
I'm Dr. Griffith.

580
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:45,034

I am so deeply sorry
for your loss,

605
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,342
but Dr. Shagrin
has confirmed...

606
00:25:16,859 --> 00:25:19,161
Mrs. Collins...

607
00:25:19,194 --> 00:25:20,996
my name
is Dr. Benson Kwan,

608
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:23,866
and I lost my brother
in an accident...

609
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:25,434
...when he was only 16.

610
00:25:27,136 --> 00:25:29,639
It was devastating, and my life
was never the same.

611
00:25:29,672 --> 00:25:32,541
And there is nothing
anyone can say

612
00:25:32,574 --> 00:25:34,343
that can take
your pain away,

613
00:25:34,376 --> 00:25:37,379
but the lives my brother saved
when he donated his organs?

614
00:25:39,014 --> 00:25:40,883
I think about them.

615
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:44,153
I still think about the
little girl who got his heart,

616
00:25:44,186 --> 00:25:45,855
the teenage boy
who got his kidney,

617
00:25:45,888 --> 00:25:48,724
and the grandmother
who got his liver.

618
00:25:48,758 --> 00:25:50,926
Because those people
give his death

619
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,828
some little bit
of meaning.

620
00:25:54,096 --> 00:25:55,831
And I cling to that.

621
00:25:55,865 --> 00:25:58,567
I cling to it
after all these years.

622
00:26:06,642 --> 00:26:08,878
Tell Dr. Shepherd
I consent.

623
00:26:19,588 --> 00:26:21,123
Thank you.
Your brother just saved

624
00:26:21,156 --> 00:26:22,457
a whole bunch more lives.

625
00:26:22,491 --> 00:26:24,559
Never had a brother,
but you're welcome.

626
00:26:34,036 --> 00:26:34,503
What does your gut say?

627
00:26:35,671 --> 00:26:37,539
My gut? Uh...

628
00:26:37,572 --> 00:26:39,441
My gut says she's getting
her organs today.

629
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:41,243
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

630
00:26:41,276 --> 00:26:44,213
Well, I don't know.
Sometimes my gut is wrong.

631
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,750
I shouldn't have told you
to go back to Minnesota.

632
00:26:47,783 --> 00:26:50,252
I called after you.
You didn't hear me.

633
00:26:50,285 --> 00:26:51,987
Oh, I-- I heard you.

634
00:26:53,422 --> 00:26:54,957
You did?
Yeah, I heard you.

635
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,558
Yeah, but...

636
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,462
I was hurt. I was.

637
00:27:00,495 --> 00:27:02,798
I wanted you to do more
than call my name.

638
00:27:02,832 --> 00:27:04,499
I wanted you
to put in some effort.

639
00:27:04,533 --> 00:27:05,835
It was a bad day.

640
00:27:05,868 --> 00:27:08,738
It's been six months.

641
00:27:08,771 --> 00:27:10,873
It's been a very difficult
six months.

642
00:27:10,906 --> 00:27:12,341
Mm-hmm.

643
00:27:12,374 --> 00:27:15,711
And you know how
I'm so stubborn and so proud.

644
00:27:15,745 --> 00:27:17,880
Same.

645
00:27:17,913 --> 00:27:19,448
Uh, you got approval.
I got approval.

646
00:27:19,481 --> 00:27:20,783
- Okay.
- Excuse you?

647
00:27:20,816 --> 00:27:22,451
We both got approval. Yeah.

648
00:27:22,484 --> 00:27:24,553
Okay, well, you both
can be in the surgery.

649
00:27:24,586 --> 00:27:25,821
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I thought I was lead surgeon.

650
00:27:25,855 --> 00:27:27,056
You are. Okay.

651
00:27:27,089 --> 00:27:28,323
Yes. He...

652
00:27:28,357 --> 00:27:30,025
You can both
be in the surgery.

653
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:31,994
Okay, let's go.

654
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:33,662
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

655
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:36,465
I read that they can turn
your body into a pod

656
00:27:36,498 --> 00:27:38,667
and plant you as fertilizer
for a tree,

657
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,902
and that's what I want.

658
00:27:39,935 --> 00:27:41,636
What?
Mom, don't be morose.

659
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,839
It's not morose.
It's what I want.

660
00:27:43,873 --> 00:27:45,975
I want to be a tree
that you and the kids

661
00:27:46,008 --> 00:27:49,779
and all the grandkids
can picnic under.

662
00:27:49,812 --> 00:27:53,615
I want to make oxygen
and fight global warming.

663
00:27:53,648 --> 00:27:55,684
I don't want to
become pollution,

664
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:59,855
and that's what a casket is,
and that's what cremation is.

665
00:27:59,889 --> 00:28:03,458
It's land pollution,
and it's air pollution.

666
00:28:03,492 --> 00:28:07,963
If I die today,
or when I die whenever,

667
00:28:07,997 --> 00:28:13,068
just remember, sweetheart,
I want to be a tree.

668
00:28:13,102 --> 00:28:15,104
I want to watch
over our family.

669
00:28:17,306 --> 00:28:18,673
Forever.

670
00:28:18,707 --> 00:28:19,942
You ready?

671
00:28:23,645 --> 00:28:25,047
I'm ready.

672
00:28:40,129 --> 00:28:41,430
It's a no.

673
00:28:42,932 --> 00:28:44,433
Uh, you said it's a no?

674
00:28:44,466 --> 00:28:46,435
Dr. Millin, would you like
to close the chest?

675
00:28:46,468 --> 00:28:49,738
What?
The heart has hematomas everywhere.

676
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:52,207
It is not usable
for transplant.

677
00:28:52,241 --> 00:28:54,043
I can close,
Dr. Pierce.

678
00:28:54,076 --> 00:28:56,678
Nonsense. She knows how to do
a running subcuticular stitch.

679
00:28:56,711 --> 00:28:59,714
I'm sure she's practiced
on a thousand oranges.

680
00:28:59,748 --> 00:29:01,416
Human flesh
is a little bit firmer.

681
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:02,818
You're gonna have to pull
a little bit harder.

682
00:29:02,852 --> 00:29:04,253
Uh, what about Howard?

683
00:29:04,286 --> 00:29:06,288
You'll explain to Howard
and his husband

684
00:29:06,321 --> 00:29:07,957
that Howard will remain
on the transplant list,

685
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,291
but today was not his day.

686
00:29:09,324 --> 00:29:10,659
B-But his husband
couldn't stop crying.

687
00:29:10,692 --> 00:29:12,427
I know. It sucks.

688
00:29:12,461 --> 00:29:14,463
But we take the good
with the bad here, Dr. Millin.

689
00:29:14,496 --> 00:29:16,932
Schmitt, keep an eye.

690
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,770
O-Okay.
Um, 4-0 Monocryl, please.

691
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:23,272
You say please to Bokhee!

692
00:29:23,305 --> 00:29:25,740
I did.

693
00:29:25,774 --> 00:29:27,242
Right here. There.

694
00:29:27,276 --> 00:29:28,677
They just keep
getting younger.

695
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:29,744
Right?

696
00:29:35,017 --> 00:29:36,852
Adams, what are you doing?

697
00:29:36,886 --> 00:29:39,421
I screwed up. I just want
to make sure she's okay.

698
00:29:39,454 --> 00:29:41,790
You want to scrub in?
For real?

699
00:29:41,823 --> 00:29:43,825
'Cause I'm pretty sure
I'm getting fired later.

700
00:29:45,627 --> 00:29:47,829
Well, if they haven't fired you
yet, you still got a shot.

701
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:50,665
Look, here's the deal.

702
00:29:50,699 --> 00:29:52,301
We all have bad days.
We all make mistakes.

703
00:29:52,334 --> 00:29:53,668
You just got to learn
from them.

704
00:29:53,702 --> 00:29:55,270
You learn from them,
you're good.

705
00:29:55,304 --> 00:29:56,638
Right?
What'd you learn today?

706
00:29:56,671 --> 00:29:58,173
Uh.

707
00:29:58,207 --> 00:30:00,142
Raise my hand
before talking,

708
00:30:00,175 --> 00:30:01,911
save the shame
for the end of the day,

709
00:30:01,944 --> 00:30:04,779
and use full names
when speaking with next of kin.

710
00:30:04,813 --> 00:30:06,448
Yes. Okay.

711
00:30:06,481 --> 00:30:07,917
That's good.

712
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:10,419
Come on.

713
00:30:10,452 --> 00:30:12,521
End your day better
than it started.

714
00:30:12,554 --> 00:30:14,756
Okay? Let's go.

715
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:16,591
Come on, let's go!

716
00:30:28,971 --> 00:30:31,340
Okay, so this is going to be
a long, arduous surgery.

717
00:30:31,373 --> 00:30:33,008
Let's pace ourselves.

718
00:30:33,042 --> 00:30:35,410
And say a prayer now
if you're the praying kind.

719
00:30:35,444 --> 00:30:37,412
The donor is Liam Collins.

720
00:30:37,446 --> 00:30:39,949
He loved rugby,
and he loved science.

721
00:30:39,982 --> 00:30:42,952
The recipient is Sarah Martinez,
and she loves nature,

722
00:30:42,985 --> 00:30:45,254
and she's about to be
a grandmother.

723
00:30:45,287 --> 00:30:47,456
It's a beautiful day
to save lives.

724
00:30:49,491 --> 00:30:51,660
It's a beautiful day
to save lives.

725
00:30:54,829 --> 00:30:56,631
Derek was a God to him.

726
00:30:58,033 --> 00:30:59,301
I know. Scalpel.

727
00:30:59,334 --> 00:31:01,603
And Lucas was
Derek's favorite nephew,

728
00:31:01,636 --> 00:31:04,106
and I do love him,
so I hate to keep saying this,

729
00:31:04,139 --> 00:31:06,041
but I don't think
he has what it takes.

730
00:31:06,075 --> 00:31:08,510
I know you don't.
He's a mess.

731
00:31:08,543 --> 00:31:09,678
He doesn't follow instructions.

732
00:31:09,711 --> 00:31:12,047
He has to do everything
his own way.

733
00:31:12,081 --> 00:31:14,316
Did you hire him because
he reminds you of Derek?

734
00:31:16,118 --> 00:31:18,853
No. Not Derek.

735
00:31:18,887 --> 00:31:21,523
He is a mess. He does need
to do things his own way.

736
00:31:21,556 --> 00:31:25,094
Mm-hmm.
But he also has a stroke
of the family genius.

737
00:31:25,127 --> 00:31:27,529
And he's a bit
of a black sheep.

738
00:31:27,562 --> 00:31:28,897
You don't see it, do you?

739
00:31:33,935 --> 00:31:35,437
Is that why
he drives me crazy?

740
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:38,507
He's me.

741
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,309
Yes, he's you.

742
00:31:40,342 --> 00:31:42,511
He's got the spark.

743
00:31:42,544 --> 00:31:44,246
He's got the drive.

744
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:46,815
He just needs a chance.

745
00:31:46,848 --> 00:31:50,085
I had to be watched very closely
at that age.

746
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:51,720

I mean, it's exhilarating.

788
00:35:17,826 --> 00:35:20,795
I-I told a person
that his wife was dead today,

789
00:35:20,829 --> 00:35:24,366
and then another man that his
husband wasn't getting a heart.

790
00:35:24,399 --> 00:35:29,137
But I also sewed human flesh
on a living human being,

791
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:33,275
which was nothing like an orange
and different from a cadaver,

this is a little awkward,

00:35:39,514 --> 00:35:41,750
but, uh, would you mind
signing this?

796
00:35:41,783 --> 00:35:43,652

This is HR paperwork.
