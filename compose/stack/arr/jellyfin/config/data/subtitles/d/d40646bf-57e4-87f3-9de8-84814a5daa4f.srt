Granny, I don't know where
your nice shoes are,

5
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:16,093
but aren't you staying home?

6
00:00:16,127 --> 00:00:17,728
Can't you just wear
your slippers?

7
00:00:17,761 --> 00:00:19,230
Well, what about
next weekend?

8
00:00:19,263 --> 00:00:20,897
<i>I'm in Miami</i>

9
00:00:20,931 --> 00:00:22,399
<i>for a National Conference
on Neuroscience.</i>

10
00:00:22,433 --> 00:00:24,768
Miami is a six-hour flight
from Seattle.

11
00:00:24,801 --> 00:00:26,437
I could get on the redeye
Friday night.

12
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,305
We'd have
all of Saturday,

13
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:30,907
and then I could fly back Sunday
in time to pick up Scout.

14
00:00:30,941 --> 00:00:33,210
Is that insane?
<i>A little.</i>

15
00:00:33,244 --> 00:00:34,978
I wish I could get on a plane
to Minnesota right now.

16
00:00:35,011 --> 00:00:36,913
<i>I'm not in Minnesota.</i>

17
00:00:36,947 --> 00:00:39,883
You're not?
Where are you?

00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:42,653

00:01:08,679 --> 00:01:10,647
You stay home from school,
you keep up with your work.

30
00:01:10,681 --> 00:01:12,149
That was our deal.

31
00:01:12,183 --> 00:01:13,016
I will never need to know
anything about

32
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:14,485
the French Revolution, ever.

33
00:01:14,518 --> 00:01:16,086
If you only know
about medicine,

34
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:17,488
what will you talk
to your patients about?

35
00:01:17,521 --> 00:01:19,290
You talk to your patients
about European history?

36
00:01:19,323 --> 00:01:21,358
<i>But true relief for these women
didn't exist...</i>

37
00:01:21,392 --> 00:01:23,294
I have to catch up
with Maggie and Nick.

38
00:01:23,327 --> 00:01:25,095
Go to my office.
I'll see you soon, okay?

00:01:25,128 --> 00:01:26,497
<i>...until physicians tried using</i>

Hey.
Zola's skipping school
again today.

42
00:01:30,734 --> 00:01:31,968
Well, she had another
panic attack,

43
00:01:32,002 --> 00:01:33,804
so what was
I supposed to do?

44
00:01:33,837 --> 00:01:37,140
<i>The cure was called
a "hysterical paroxysm"...</i>

45
00:01:37,174 --> 00:01:39,943
Wow.
What are you doing here?

46
00:01:39,976 --> 00:01:42,346
None of your business.
I'm a private citizen.

47
00:01:42,379 --> 00:01:45,349
<i>...which today has come
to be known as an orgasm.</i>

48
00:01:45,382 --> 00:01:48,885
Uh, yeah, I may have, uh, given
her and Dr. Wilson permission

49
00:01:48,919 --> 00:01:51,522
to use the interns
for a special project.

50
00:01:51,555 --> 00:01:53,790
You gave away our surgical
interns for the entire day?

51
00:01:53,824 --> 00:01:57,328
Well, I mean, the project's
important, and...

52
00:01:57,361 --> 00:01:58,995
do you really want
to tell Bailey no?

53
00:01:59,029 --> 00:02:01,198
<i>Modern medicine continues
to recognize</i>

54
00:02:01,232 --> 00:02:04,034
<i>the stress-reducing benefits

00:02:04,067 --> 00:02:06,036
<i>But doctors no longer
perform the cure.</i>

56
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:07,638
Sign these.

57
00:02:07,671 --> 00:02:09,373
What are they?

58
00:02:09,406 --> 00:02:10,641
Release forms.

59
00:02:10,674 --> 00:02:12,409
For what?
Okay, new rule--

60
00:02:12,443 --> 00:02:14,511
No questions before 8:00 a.m.

61
00:02:14,545 --> 00:02:17,180
Well, we just
want to know what we--
Save it for 8:01.

62
00:02:17,214 --> 00:02:18,882
I'll be in the pit
if you desperately need me

63
00:02:18,915 --> 00:02:20,551
and there is absolutely
no one else

64
00:02:20,584 --> 00:02:22,686
in your general vicinity
who can help.

65
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:25,989
Okay, but where--
People, it's very simple--
no questions.

66
00:02:26,022 --> 00:02:27,758
You just didn't tell us
where we're going.

67
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:30,160
You're with Dr. Bailey.
Who's Dr. Bailey?

68
00:02:30,193 --> 00:02:31,362
Wow, blasphemy.

69
00:02:31,395 --> 00:02:32,729
I am Dr. Bailey.

70
00:02:34,631 --> 00:02:37,368
What are you waiting for?
Let's go.

71
00:02:37,401 --> 00:02:38,835
I'm so sorry.

72
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:40,437
I-I thought I met
all the attendings.

73
00:02:40,471 --> 00:02:42,005
I'm Mika Yasuda.

74
00:02:42,038 --> 00:02:43,574
No need to apologize.
I don't work here.

75
00:02:43,607 --> 00:02:47,177
Dr. Bailey was chief of surgery
until about six months ago.

76
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,779
I left to spend time
with my family.

77
00:02:48,812 --> 00:02:50,514
That's nice.

78
00:02:50,547 --> 00:02:52,449
It was, and then
the Supreme Court went

79
00:02:52,483 --> 00:02:54,951
and stripped women
of our reproductive rights.

80
00:02:54,985 --> 00:02:58,255
Dr. Wilson has been helping me
with a sex-ed curriculum

81
00:02:58,289 --> 00:03:00,090
to teach teenagers
about their bodies

82
00:03:00,123 --> 00:03:02,025
because we now live
in a country

83
00:03:02,058 --> 00:03:03,627
where the only way
to guarantee

84
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,263
you don't have to carry
an unwanted pregnancy

85
00:03:06,297 --> 00:03:07,598
is to not get pregnant.

86
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:09,132
And
statistically speaking,

87
00:03:09,165 --> 00:03:11,802
teens need some big help
with that.

88
00:03:11,835 --> 00:03:14,705
So we are making
sex-education videos

89
00:03:14,738 --> 00:03:15,939
to put up on social media.

90
00:03:15,972 --> 00:03:17,641
We want to go viral--

91
00:03:17,674 --> 00:03:19,109
you know, like that cat
that plays the piano.

92
00:03:19,142 --> 00:03:21,111
Oh, come on, people,
get with it.

93
00:03:21,144 --> 00:03:22,546
Dr. Bailey,
we're surgical interns.

94
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:24,548
We have progress notes
and nurses paging us,

95
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:26,149
and we're behind
on discharge summaries.

96
00:03:26,182 --> 00:03:27,751
I don't even have time
to look at my phone.

97
00:03:27,784 --> 00:03:29,553
I've got
like 600 unread texts.

98
00:03:29,586 --> 00:03:31,555
Nurses love me.
You won't be bothered today.

99
00:03:31,588 --> 00:03:34,124
And in exchange
for your cooperation,

100
00:03:34,157 --> 00:03:36,327
you get the benefit
of working

101
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,230
with yet another
world-class surgeon.

102
00:03:42,866 --> 00:03:45,201
Dr. Montgomery.

103
00:03:50,006 --> 00:03:51,642
Oh, don't look so miserable.

104
00:03:51,675 --> 00:03:54,277
You're getting paid
to talk about sex today.

105
00:03:54,311 --> 00:03:57,080
Sex is fun, and I need you
to look like it.

106
00:04:17,734 --> 00:04:19,836
Okay.

107
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,973
Addie, you really pulled out
all the stops on this one.

108
00:04:23,006 --> 00:04:24,841
And I am
so grateful.

109
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,378
Well, I spend
every waking moment

110
00:04:27,411 --> 00:04:29,145
obsessing about the state of
women's health in this country,

111
00:04:29,179 --> 00:04:30,981
so this was an easy yes.

112
00:04:31,014 --> 00:04:33,684
Yeah. How much fallout are you
experiencing in California?

113
00:04:33,717 --> 00:04:36,387
Last week,
I had five patients

114
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,889
asking for prophylactic
tubal ligations

115
00:04:38,922 --> 00:04:40,323
before they go
to college,

116
00:04:40,357 --> 00:04:41,692
because they're afraid
of getting pregnant

117
00:04:41,725 --> 00:04:43,226
in hostile states.

118
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:44,961
18-year-olds wanting to get
their tubes tied.

119
00:04:44,995 --> 00:04:47,364
I mean,
it's the actual apocalypse.

120
00:04:47,398 --> 00:04:50,033
18? I didn't even want kids
until I was 30.

121
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:52,903
Hi.
I'm Jo Wilson.

122
00:04:52,936 --> 00:04:54,838
We actually met during
your grand rounds

123
00:04:54,871 --> 00:04:56,540
on uterine transplants.

124
00:04:56,573 --> 00:04:59,209
And Dr. Schmitt is a g--
is a good friend of mine.

125
00:04:59,242 --> 00:05:01,044
Unless you didn't like him.
Then I hate him.

126
00:05:01,077 --> 00:05:03,480
Dr. Wilson,
I've heard great things.

127
00:05:03,514 --> 00:05:05,315
Uh...

128
00:05:05,348 --> 00:05:07,117
Would you excuse me
just a minute?
Mm-hmm. Sure.

129
00:05:09,085 --> 00:05:11,755
I cannot believe it.
Shep--

130
00:05:11,788 --> 00:05:13,690
Dr. Montgomery.

131
00:05:13,724 --> 00:05:16,693
It's a-- an-- an honor
to be working with you.

132
00:05:16,727 --> 00:05:19,696
I'm-- I'm a huge fan of--
of-- of fertility

133
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,432
and-- and your work in it, specifically.

134
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:25,001
Hi.
I'm Dr. Montgomery.

135
00:05:25,035 --> 00:05:27,203
Simone Griffith. Dr. Griffith.
Dr.-- Dr. Simone Griffith.

136
00:05:27,237 --> 00:05:28,672
Sorry, I'm starstruck.

137
00:05:37,481 --> 00:05:39,115
What do you mean,
I don't have any interns?

138
00:05:39,149 --> 00:05:40,451
They're off on some
special assignment.

139
00:05:40,484 --> 00:05:42,586
Well, what, did they enlist?
Bring them back, Owen.

140
00:05:42,619 --> 00:05:44,721
I have a full pit,
one surgical resident,

141
00:05:44,755 --> 00:05:46,523
and you, who's worse
than useless to me.

142
00:05:46,557 --> 00:05:48,058
You know what?
Talk to someone who cares.

143
00:05:48,091 --> 00:05:50,226
Oh, excuse me,
Dr. Altman.
What?

144
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,096
Well, as much as I respect
the purpose

145
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:54,798
and intention
of Dr. Bailey's project,

146
00:05:54,831 --> 00:05:57,601
I could really use some more
hands-on experience in the pit.

147
00:05:57,634 --> 00:06:00,637
I'll do H&Ps, run labs, suture,
drain abscesses.

148
00:06:00,671 --> 00:06:02,072
I'll do anything
you need.

149
00:06:02,105 --> 00:06:04,374
Mm. You happy now?
Don't answer that.

150
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:06,109
You're never happy.

151
00:06:06,142 --> 00:06:08,378
I'm a very happy person.
He's just bitter and broken.

152
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:10,380
Let's go.

153
00:06:10,413 --> 00:06:12,649
These are your scripts.
Stick to them.

154
00:06:12,683 --> 00:06:17,153
STDs, menstrual cycle, anatomy,

155
00:06:17,187 --> 00:06:18,789
and you're all
on contraception.

156
00:06:18,822 --> 00:06:20,791
Uh, Dr. Webber,
there's plenty to go around.

157
00:06:20,824 --> 00:06:22,493
Would you like to pick
a topic?
Richard?

158
00:06:22,526 --> 00:06:25,996
Uh, when I was 15,
I was handed a sack of flour

159
00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:28,499
to care
and treat like a baby.

160
00:06:28,532 --> 00:06:30,266
Do you have that?

161
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,335
I'll be in my office.

162
00:06:32,368 --> 00:06:35,271
Alright, uh, any questions,
comments, concerns?

163
00:06:35,305 --> 00:06:37,641
Um, yeah.

164
00:06:37,674 --> 00:06:41,478
This is very important and all,
but I am not your guy.

165
00:06:41,512 --> 00:06:43,614
Never had sex before?

166
00:06:43,647 --> 00:06:46,349
This is your assignment today,
so you are our guy.

167
00:06:46,382 --> 00:06:48,785
I think what Dr. Kwan
is trying to say is, uh,

168
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:50,487
we're not
exactly qualified for this.

169
00:06:50,521 --> 00:06:52,322
Yeah.
Okay, do you understand

170
00:06:52,355 --> 00:06:54,591
that hundreds of thousands
of teenagers

171
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:55,926
will become pregnant
this year?

172
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,961
And now a lot of
those children

173
00:06:57,994 --> 00:07:01,431
will be forced
to carry their babies to term,

174
00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:04,868
or worse, give themselves
back-alley illegal abortions,

175
00:07:04,901 --> 00:07:06,803
get septic, and die.

176
00:07:06,837 --> 00:07:09,540
So if you all want to go hold
a retractor, go ahead.

177
00:07:09,573 --> 00:07:12,275
The rest of us will be here
saving lives.

178
00:07:12,308 --> 00:07:13,644
Hmm.

179
00:07:13,677 --> 00:07:16,446
Oh, s-so, we just talk
into the camera?

180
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,348
Not quite.
Come on in.

181
00:07:18,381 --> 00:07:20,984
I've organized volunteers
at my son's high school.

182
00:07:21,017 --> 00:07:22,352
Actual nightmare.

183
00:07:22,385 --> 00:07:23,987
No.

184
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,388
Can't teach
without students.

185
00:07:25,421 --> 00:07:28,024
Hi.
Hi, everybody.

186
00:07:28,058 --> 00:07:29,793
Hi.
There we go.

187
00:07:38,268 --> 00:07:40,336
Excuse me, young man.

188
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,806
Where's labor and delivery?

189
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:45,308
Are you looking for someone?
Yes, my daughter.

190
00:07:45,341 --> 00:07:47,143
Her name is Denise.
Have you seen her?

191
00:07:47,177 --> 00:07:49,079
No. Um...

192
00:07:49,112 --> 00:07:52,248
She's having my grandbaby today.
I brought sustenance.

193
00:07:52,282 --> 00:07:55,018
Hey, Adams!
Come here.

194
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,722
Um, this is, uh...

195
00:07:58,755 --> 00:08:00,256
Joyce-- Joyce Ward.

196
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,592
Can you help her
find her daughter?

197
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,660
She's in labor.
Can't an orderly do that?

198
00:08:03,694 --> 00:08:05,762
You want to go back
to sex class?

199
00:08:08,031 --> 00:08:09,866
Please follow me, ma'am.

200
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,569
Hey. Yeah?

201
00:08:12,603 --> 00:08:15,271
Uh, is it true that you, uh,
gave away the surgical interns?

202
00:08:15,305 --> 00:08:16,873
Yeah, it's just for one day, though.

203
00:08:16,907 --> 00:08:18,675
How much of the day?

204
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:20,343
'Cause I need them to round
on Maggie's patients.

205
00:08:20,376 --> 00:08:21,678
Otherwise, I'll need to round
on her patients,

206
00:08:21,712 --> 00:08:23,246
as well as
my own patients. Right.

207
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:24,748
What are they even doing?

208
00:08:24,781 --> 00:08:28,418
Uh, sex videos to prevent
teen pregnancy.

209
00:08:28,451 --> 00:08:29,920
Sex videos?

210
00:08:29,953 --> 00:08:33,690
Uh, no.
Uh, sex-education videos.

211
00:08:33,724 --> 00:08:35,125
Oh, okay, well, that--

212
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:36,259
that's an important word
in that sentence.

213
00:08:36,292 --> 00:08:37,527
It is.

214
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,696
Okay, I guess
I'll start rounds, then.

215
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,231
Okay.
Okay.

216
00:08:41,264 --> 00:08:43,233
Woman on P.A.:
<i>Dr. Seip, 4617.</i>

217
00:08:43,266 --> 00:08:45,135
<i>Dr. Jen Seip, 4617.</i>

218
00:08:48,138 --> 00:08:50,641
Hey.
What you doing down here?

219
00:08:50,674 --> 00:08:52,809
Uh, just going
to the bathroom.

220
00:08:52,843 --> 00:08:54,310
Y-You're going
to the bathroom?

221
00:08:54,344 --> 00:08:56,446
You walked across
a pedestrian bridge,

222
00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:58,048
you took an elevator
down three flights,

223
00:08:58,081 --> 00:08:59,916
when there's a bathroom
in your mom's office?

224
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,886
That's what that door is?

225
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,755
What's up?

226
00:09:04,788 --> 00:09:07,423
Okay, fine, I was looking for
a gallery to watch surgery.

227
00:09:07,457 --> 00:09:08,759
Ah.
Please don't tell
my mom.

228
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:10,426
I can't do more
history homework. I can't.

229
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,996
Yeah, well, I never really liked
history either.

230
00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:14,430
All the battles
you have to memorize,

231
00:09:14,464 --> 00:09:15,932
the old dudes
with the wigs.

232
00:09:15,966 --> 00:09:17,668
Who thought
that looked good?

233
00:09:17,701 --> 00:09:20,937
Okay, well, I don't have to be
in surgery for a few hours.

234
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:23,640
You want to see
something cool?

235
00:09:23,674 --> 00:09:26,342
Okay, let's go.

236
00:09:26,376 --> 00:09:29,345
Track your menstrual cycle
with pen and paper, no apps.

237
00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:31,948
If you get an abortion,
hostile states might be able

238
00:09:31,982 --> 00:09:35,151
to use your phone as evidence
against you in criminal court.

239
00:09:35,185 --> 00:09:38,121
If your period is late,
take a pregnancy test.

240
00:09:38,154 --> 00:09:40,924
Um, medical abortions
are still, uh,

241
00:09:40,957 --> 00:09:43,526
legal and available
in many states.

242
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:45,762
But, um, uh--

243
00:09:45,796 --> 00:09:47,931
But you have to know
that you're pregnant early

244
00:09:47,964 --> 00:09:49,199
if you want to use it.

245
00:09:49,232 --> 00:09:51,367
Take one birth control pill
by mouth

246
00:09:51,401 --> 00:09:52,969
every day at the same time.

247
00:09:53,003 --> 00:09:55,171
Or you can get an IUD
or an implant.

248
00:09:55,205 --> 00:09:59,375
IUD goes into the uterus.
An implant goes into your arm.

249
00:09:59,409 --> 00:10:03,213
Both are 99% effective
at preventing pregnancy.

250
00:10:03,246 --> 00:10:05,515
Morning-after pill.

251
00:10:05,548 --> 00:10:10,320
Uh, if the first layer
of contraception fails,

252
00:10:10,353 --> 00:10:13,690
take this as soon as possible
to, um, prevent pregnancy.

253
00:10:13,724 --> 00:10:16,960
Oh, look, see, that girl over
there is paying attention.

254
00:10:16,993 --> 00:10:20,196
Oh, wait, no,
I just didn't see her phone.

255
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,832
"Get young people,"
you said.

256
00:10:21,865 --> 00:10:23,800
"They'll be good at this,"
you said.

257
00:10:29,906 --> 00:10:32,508
I know. I am sorry.

258
00:10:32,542 --> 00:10:35,045
I forgot.
I've got too much going on.

259
00:10:35,078 --> 00:10:37,313
Well, I will do it tonight
when I can't sleep.

260
00:10:39,382 --> 00:10:40,984
Look, can we talk
about this later, please?

261
00:10:41,017 --> 00:10:43,019
Okay. Bye. I love you.

262
00:10:43,053 --> 00:10:44,888
Hey.

263
00:10:44,921 --> 00:10:47,690
Are you okay?

264
00:10:47,724 --> 00:10:50,193
Do you remember
when the state fair was?

265
00:10:50,226 --> 00:10:51,728
Was it three weeks ago?

266
00:10:51,762 --> 00:10:54,530
Oh, I'm sorry, I don't.
I don't live here.

267
00:10:54,564 --> 00:10:57,200
Doesn't matter.

268
00:10:57,233 --> 00:10:58,701
Either way, it's late.

269
00:10:58,735 --> 00:11:00,236
What's late?

270
00:11:03,606 --> 00:11:06,076
Oh.

271
00:11:06,109 --> 00:11:10,280
Okay, well, um,
your period can be late

272
00:11:10,313 --> 00:11:12,682
for all sorts of reasons.

273
00:11:12,715 --> 00:11:15,251
But if you want, I can take you
for a blood test,

274
00:11:15,285 --> 00:11:17,253
just to be sure.

275
00:11:17,287 --> 00:11:18,855
Are you a doctor?

276
00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:20,623
Yes, I am a doctor.

277
00:11:20,656 --> 00:11:22,258
And you won't tell
my parents?

278
00:11:22,292 --> 00:11:24,560
No, this is between
you and me.

279
00:11:29,099 --> 00:11:30,266
I-- Okay, I get it.

280
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,601
Did you tell the coordinator

281
00:11:31,634 --> 00:11:33,703
that the patient's
a rare HLA match?

282
00:11:33,736 --> 00:11:36,706
Okay, well, call them back
and send the latest labs.

283
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:38,474
Thank you.

284
00:11:38,508 --> 00:11:40,576
Okay, what you want to do
is you take the left grasper

285
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:44,280
and pass the peg
to the right grasper.

286
00:11:44,314 --> 00:11:46,716
Huh.

287
00:11:46,749 --> 00:11:48,051
Did I do it wrong?

288
00:11:48,084 --> 00:11:50,486
No, you did it,
uh, seamlessly.

289
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,255
You sure your mom's
never shown you this before?

290
00:11:52,288 --> 00:11:53,489
No, I swear.
No?

291
00:11:53,523 --> 00:11:55,291
Okay, well,
I'm not gonna tell you

292
00:11:55,325 --> 00:11:56,860
how long it took
for me to nail that.

293
00:11:59,863 --> 00:12:02,665
Did you always know
you wanted to be a doctor?

294
00:12:02,698 --> 00:12:04,767
Me?
Wow.

295
00:12:04,801 --> 00:12:06,302
Uh, no.
Gosh, no.

296
00:12:06,336 --> 00:12:09,439
Um, at first
I wanted to be the Flash.

297
00:12:09,472 --> 00:12:11,107
I thought he was underrated
but cool.

298
00:12:11,141 --> 00:12:13,576
Then I thought I was gonna
play professional baseball.

299
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:15,345
That did not work out.

300
00:12:15,378 --> 00:12:19,850
And, uh, then I decided I was
gonna be a science teacher.

301
00:12:19,883 --> 00:12:21,784
And then what happened?

302
00:12:21,818 --> 00:12:25,021
Well, um--
Well, my mom died.

303
00:12:28,391 --> 00:12:29,759
You know, I forgot one.

304
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:31,928
At one point, I was gonna be
an astronaut.

305
00:12:31,962 --> 00:12:34,330
You liked space?

306
00:12:34,364 --> 00:12:36,299
Uh, no,
I liked the ice cream.

307
00:12:36,332 --> 00:12:39,369
What?

308
00:12:39,402 --> 00:12:41,304
Where is your enthusiasm,

309
00:12:41,337 --> 00:12:42,805
your-- your passion
for science?

310
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:44,140
We're losing them.

311
00:12:44,174 --> 00:12:45,108
We're reading all the facts
you gave us.

312
00:12:45,141 --> 00:12:46,542
You've turned it
into ASMR.

313
00:12:46,576 --> 00:12:48,144
You need to modulate
your voices.

314
00:12:48,178 --> 00:12:50,113
You know, connect!

315
00:12:50,146 --> 00:12:52,148
If I wanted someone to just read
facts from a sheet of paper,

316
00:12:52,182 --> 00:12:53,349
I could have
done that myself.

317
00:12:53,383 --> 00:12:55,318
Respectfully, we are not
the problem.

318
00:12:55,351 --> 00:12:57,553
These are boring factoids
that you could look up online.

319
00:12:57,587 --> 00:13:00,056
We need to teach these
kids something they
want to learn about,

320
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:02,158
engage their
sexual curiosity.

321
00:13:02,192 --> 00:13:04,995
No. Dr. Wilson wrote
a thorough curriculum.

322
00:13:05,028 --> 00:13:06,462
Just stick
with the script.

323
00:13:06,496 --> 00:13:08,564
Be better.

324
00:13:08,598 --> 00:13:10,466
Aah!

325
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,035
Hey, hey, can you tell us
what hurts?

326
00:13:12,068 --> 00:13:13,736
She's tachy.

327
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:16,339
And she feels warm.
Uh, get me a gurney right now.

328
00:13:16,372 --> 00:13:17,207
Dr. Wilson...

329
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:25,815
Wow.
It's basically
like a video game.

330
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:28,151
10 years of training,

331
00:13:28,184 --> 00:13:30,153
and I could have just been
playing a video game.

332
00:13:30,186 --> 00:13:31,721
I don't think they made this
back then.

333
00:13:31,754 --> 00:13:35,191
Wow!
Ouch. Okay.

334
00:13:35,225 --> 00:13:37,260
Mind if I use
one of these tables?

335
00:13:37,293 --> 00:13:39,229
Oh, hey. I didn't--
I didn't know you were here.

336
00:13:39,262 --> 00:13:41,164
Oh, I came up last minute
to see Amelia.

337
00:13:41,197 --> 00:13:43,166
Thought I'd do some
data analysis

338
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,200
until she's finished
with work.

339
00:13:44,234 --> 00:13:45,601
How's the, uh--
How's the trial?

340
00:13:45,635 --> 00:13:47,437
We are hoping to start
the next phase

341
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,272
in the next
couple of months

342
00:13:49,305 --> 00:13:51,741
if David doesn't fire
this latest research director.

343
00:13:51,774 --> 00:13:53,376
Yes.

344
00:13:53,409 --> 00:13:55,211
Meredith Grey is not easy
to replace.

345
00:13:55,245 --> 00:13:58,448
No. No, she's not.
She's not.

346
00:13:58,481 --> 00:13:59,950
How's the new gig?
I like it.

347
00:13:59,983 --> 00:14:01,251
I think
I'm pretty good at it.

348
00:14:01,284 --> 00:14:03,353
Uh, Zola,
what do you think?

349
00:14:03,386 --> 00:14:05,621
Mom says
you take big swings.

350
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,059
Did you do that
just now?

351
00:14:09,092 --> 00:14:11,661
Mm-hmm.
Is it okay?

352
00:14:13,063 --> 00:14:15,898
That's a cognitive puzzle.

353
00:14:15,932 --> 00:14:18,034
Most adults can't do it
that fast.

354
00:14:18,068 --> 00:14:20,070
Hmm.

355
00:14:20,103 --> 00:14:22,638
You know, I have six
other grandchildren.

356
00:14:22,672 --> 00:14:24,274
But Denise is my baby.

357
00:14:24,307 --> 00:14:26,442
She needs me with her.

358
00:14:26,476 --> 00:14:28,744
Uh, excuse me.
We're looking for Denise Ward.

359
00:14:28,778 --> 00:14:30,246
This is her mother.

360
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,648
Griffith--
Denise Griffith.

361
00:14:32,682 --> 00:14:33,783
She took
her husband's name.

362
00:14:33,816 --> 00:14:35,718
I'm not an O.B. nurse.

363
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:37,620
And you have a tablet
in your armpit.

364
00:14:37,653 --> 00:14:39,455
Just...

365
00:14:41,491 --> 00:14:43,659
Are you sure
Denise came here?

366
00:14:43,693 --> 00:14:45,295
Uh, maybe she went to
Seattle Pres.

367
00:14:45,328 --> 00:14:47,330
No, no, she said
Seattle Grace.

368
00:14:49,299 --> 00:14:50,833
Uh, okay, got it.

369
00:14:50,866 --> 00:14:53,436
Just give me a minute
to find your daughter's chart.

370
00:14:53,469 --> 00:14:56,306
You know, if they have a boy,
they're gonna name him Calvin.

371
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:59,109
I don't love it,
but I'm staying out of it.

372
00:14:59,142 --> 00:15:03,013
I hope it's a girl,
'cause if they have a girl,

373
00:15:03,046 --> 00:15:04,780
they're gonna
name her Simone.

374
00:15:04,814 --> 00:15:05,848
Isn't that beautiful?

375
00:15:05,881 --> 00:15:08,418
Simone.

376
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,522
Did we get ahold
of her parents?

377
00:15:12,555 --> 00:15:13,990
Mom's on the way.

378
00:15:14,024 --> 00:15:16,192
She also said it could
just be bad cramps,

379
00:15:16,226 --> 00:15:19,996
because Diamond has
"extremely traumatic periods."

380
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,497
"Traumatic"
or "dramatic"?

381
00:15:21,531 --> 00:15:23,133
It's unclear.

382
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,501
Diamond,
are you on your period?

383
00:15:25,535 --> 00:15:27,270
<i>Did my mom
tell you that?</i>

384
00:15:27,303 --> 00:15:29,772
She tells everyone when
I'm on my freaking period.

385
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:31,207
I get a bad grade
on a math quiz,

386
00:15:31,241 --> 00:15:33,209
she tells my teacher
I'm on my period.

387
00:15:33,243 --> 00:15:34,977
Like, we bleed.
Why does it matter?

388
00:15:35,011 --> 00:15:39,315
<i>I'm the virgin who likes anime,
who passed out</i>

389
00:15:39,349 --> 00:15:41,884
during sex-ed class.

390
00:15:41,917 --> 00:15:43,353
Wow!

391
00:15:43,386 --> 00:15:46,322
That's a giant cyst
on the left side.

392
00:15:46,356 --> 00:15:48,624
Look, it's-- it's displaced
her entire abdomen.

393
00:15:48,658 --> 00:15:50,526
And look, whirlpool sign
on the right.

394
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,629
The vasculature is twisted,
suggesting ovarian torsion.

395
00:15:53,663 --> 00:15:55,065
She'll need surgery
right away.

396
00:15:55,098 --> 00:15:56,332
Well, then let's go.

397
00:15:56,366 --> 00:15:58,834
Book an O.R.
and call her parents.

398
00:15:58,868 --> 00:16:00,636
Dr. DeLuca is still
in her hysterectomy.

399
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,638
I have never done one of these
on my own.

400
00:16:02,672 --> 00:16:04,407
Well, good thing we know
someone who has.

401
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,743
Find Dr. Montgomery.
She's gonna need privileges.

402
00:16:07,777 --> 00:16:08,878
So are you.

403
00:16:10,713 --> 00:16:14,084
Double up
to protect against STDs.

404
00:16:14,117 --> 00:16:17,019
The pill and a condom,
an IUD and a condom,

405
00:16:17,053 --> 00:16:21,391
but never use two condoms
at the same time.

406
00:16:21,424 --> 00:16:23,559
They'll break, and you...

407
00:16:23,593 --> 00:16:25,828
Ooh!--
could get pregnant.

408
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:28,698
What are you doing?
Just got paged to the pit.
Bye!

409
00:16:30,633 --> 00:16:32,702
You don't want me
demonstrating condoms.

410
00:16:32,735 --> 00:16:34,504
I mostly have sex
with women. Mm.

411
00:16:34,537 --> 00:16:36,406
Uh, and I don't want to.

412
00:16:36,439 --> 00:16:38,341
Why did you even go
to medical school

413
00:16:38,374 --> 00:16:40,343
if you don't want
to help people?
Do want to help people.

414
00:16:40,376 --> 00:16:42,378
When they're under anesthesia
and can't ask me questions.

415
00:16:42,412 --> 00:16:44,280
Are you a Capricorn?
That's not a real thing.

416
00:16:44,314 --> 00:16:47,283
Okay, no,
that is for the condoms.

417
00:16:58,428 --> 00:17:00,396
Who wants to know
where the clitoris is?

418
00:17:02,765 --> 00:17:05,768
The vaginal opening
is right around here.

419
00:17:05,801 --> 00:17:08,204
And then you go up, up, up,

420
00:17:08,238 --> 00:17:11,874
and this point at the very top
is the clitoris.

421
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:14,644
Now, it's a bundle of
extremely sensitive nerves.

422
00:17:14,677 --> 00:17:18,314
So, if you touch it too hard,
you will cause pain.

423
00:17:18,348 --> 00:17:21,951
You want to approach gently
with a flat hand.

424
00:17:21,984 --> 00:17:24,254
Gently, no poking.

425
00:17:24,287 --> 00:17:25,755
It's not a button.

426
00:17:25,788 --> 00:17:27,590
Yeah, and for those of you
with vaginas,

427
00:17:27,623 --> 00:17:30,793
getting to know this part
of your body on your own

428
00:17:30,826 --> 00:17:32,895
is the easiest way
to avoid getting pregnant.

429
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:35,064
Have you ever tried to...

430
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:36,466
really hold on,

431
00:17:36,499 --> 00:17:38,468
like you're riding
on a roller coaster,

432
00:17:38,501 --> 00:17:41,337
and you're not allowed to scream
until you get off the ride?

433
00:17:41,371 --> 00:17:42,972
That is the pull-out method.

434
00:17:43,005 --> 00:17:44,474
It is truly an excellent way

435
00:17:44,507 --> 00:17:45,975
to accidentally
get someone pregnant.

436
00:17:46,008 --> 00:17:47,977
Dr. Millin?
Thank you, Doctor.

437
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,145
♪ It's amazing, we made it

438
00:17:49,179 --> 00:17:50,480
Dr. Kwan?
Thank you, Doctor.

439
00:17:50,513 --> 00:17:53,082
Now, hold it at the tip
of an erect penis.

440
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:55,084
That part's
very important.

441
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:57,253
And then
you roll it down...

442
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,758
You out of practice?

443
00:18:02,792 --> 00:18:05,295
Never had to put a condom on
anything as small as a banana.

444
00:18:05,328 --> 00:18:07,263
You get a condom,

445
00:18:07,297 --> 00:18:09,131
you get a condom,
you get a condom!

446
00:18:09,165 --> 00:18:12,134
Everybody gets a condom!

447
00:18:12,168 --> 00:18:13,135
Whoo!

448
00:18:13,169 --> 00:18:14,470
Any more questions?

449
00:18:14,504 --> 00:18:16,038
♪ Whoo

450
00:18:18,408 --> 00:18:20,343
Ah, Schmitt.

451
00:18:20,376 --> 00:18:21,777
Just the person
I was looking for.

452
00:18:21,811 --> 00:18:23,546
Oh, Dr. Montgomery,
please don't make me

453
00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:25,047
teach sex ed
to high schoolers.

454
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,383
I hated high school.
I-I can't go back. I can't.

455
00:18:27,417 --> 00:18:28,718
This isn't about sex ed.

456
00:18:28,751 --> 00:18:30,986
Oh, well, in that case, hi.
How are you?

457
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,623
I have a patient.

458
00:18:33,656 --> 00:18:35,558
She's waiting on
a pregnancy test.

459
00:18:35,591 --> 00:18:37,393
I have got to run into
an emergent ovarian torsion.

460
00:18:37,427 --> 00:18:39,529
Can you keep an eye out for
the results and deliver them?

461
00:18:39,562 --> 00:18:40,863
Of course.

462
00:18:40,896 --> 00:18:42,365
And, Schmitt,
she's scared.

463
00:18:42,398 --> 00:18:44,500
Oh, I can relate to a scared
high schooler.

464
00:18:44,534 --> 00:18:47,370
One of our students collapsed.
She has an ovarian torsion.

465
00:18:47,403 --> 00:18:49,038
I want to get her in the O.R.
right away.

466
00:18:49,071 --> 00:18:50,373
May I have privileges?

467
00:18:50,406 --> 00:18:51,874
Uh,
I-I didn't catch that.

468
00:18:51,907 --> 00:18:53,243
Could you say that again, louder?

469
00:18:53,276 --> 00:18:55,845
I am requesting privileges, please.

470
00:18:55,878 --> 00:18:57,880
Do you have
a résumé with you?
For real?

471
00:18:57,913 --> 00:19:00,316
Standard operating procedures.
Any references?

472
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,985
Are you done?
Privileges granted.

473
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:04,186
What about the sex ed?

474
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,921
Oh, she needs
experienced hands,

475
00:19:05,955 --> 00:19:07,657
but if you want to check
on the interns...

476

That's not funny, Denise.

483
00:19:22,772 --> 00:19:24,240
I'm not Denise, Granny.
I'm Simone.

No, no, no, no.

No. Get away from me.

Get away from me.
Granny, come on.

00:19:44,894 --> 00:19:46,228
Somebody help!
It's me.

495
00:19:46,262 --> 00:19:48,431
Hi.
Can I help?

00:19:48,464 --> 00:19:50,366
It's okay, it's okay.

Ma'am, can I help you?

498
00:19:53,336 --> 00:19:55,471
Should we take
some deep breaths?

499
00:20:00,142 --> 00:20:01,877
Deep breaths.
There we go.

500
00:20:06,949 --> 00:20:09,385
How can I help you?

501
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:13,423
Can you
help me find my daughter?

502
00:20:13,456 --> 00:20:16,492
I would love to help you

00:20:25,668 --> 00:20:27,437
Did he page you too?
Yeah.

504
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,238
What's going on?

505
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:30,940
Why isn't Zola
doing her homework?

506
00:20:30,973 --> 00:20:33,108
Well, we got--
we got sidetracked.

507
00:20:33,142 --> 00:20:34,076
And you called us
because...?

508
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:35,311
Well,
Meredith's in surgery,

509
00:20:35,345 --> 00:20:37,246
and I needed someone else
to see this.

510
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:39,582
Look at this.
Is she doing
neurocognitive puzzles?

511
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:41,651
No, she's not doing them,
she's killing them,
one after the next.

512
00:20:41,684 --> 00:20:43,586
I have never seen anything
like it. Watch.

513
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,089
Did she just...?
Yeah.

514
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:49,124
I couldn't even understand
the instructions that fast.

515
00:20:49,158 --> 00:20:51,427
Look at her. She's so relaxed,
like it's nothing. Yeah.

516
00:20:51,461 --> 00:20:53,128
I mean, what do we do with this?
What is this?

517
00:20:53,162 --> 00:20:54,330
"Guinness Book
of World Records"?

518
00:20:54,364 --> 00:20:55,498
You skip high school,
go straight to college?

519
00:20:55,531 --> 00:20:56,932
What am
I looking at here?

520
00:20:56,966 --> 00:20:59,335
Feel like I'm watching
the U.S. Open.

521
00:20:59,369 --> 00:21:01,871
Uh, hey, could I steal you
for a half-hour?

522
00:21:01,904 --> 00:21:03,172
It's for a sex-ed thing.

523
00:21:03,205 --> 00:21:04,940
Uh, yeah,
we talked about this.

524
00:21:04,974 --> 00:21:06,141
I'm your superior.
I--

525
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,777
No, it's for
a literal sex-ed thing.

526
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:10,312
I need help with
a literal sex video, Link.

527
00:21:10,346 --> 00:21:12,682
Wow.
Still very not-okay.

528
00:21:12,715 --> 00:21:14,950
And, you know, I'd prefer
if you call me Dr. Lincoln.

529
00:21:14,984 --> 00:21:16,185
Everyone calls you Link.

530
00:21:16,218 --> 00:21:18,020
Everyone except you,
moving forward.

531
00:21:18,053 --> 00:21:19,522
Okay,
can you just do it?

532
00:21:19,555 --> 00:21:21,391
I mean, we are flying by
the seat of our pants up there.

533
00:21:21,424 --> 00:21:22,825
No. No, I don't want
to lose my job today.

534
00:21:22,858 --> 00:21:24,527
It's teaching.
Or harassment.

535
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,895
And I don't want to
tempt fate.

536
00:21:25,928 --> 00:21:27,630
Which one of us
is being harassed?

537
00:21:27,663 --> 00:21:28,831
I don't think it matters.
Find an actual couple.

538
00:21:31,066 --> 00:21:33,335
Ah, Dr. Ndugu,
could you and Dr. Pierce

539
00:21:33,369 --> 00:21:34,970
please demonstrate
sexual consent

540
00:21:35,004 --> 00:21:36,539
for a roomful
of teenagers?

541
00:21:36,572 --> 00:21:38,574
I...

542
00:21:38,608 --> 00:21:41,844
No.

543
00:21:41,877 --> 00:21:45,715
Consensual sex requires no
verbal persuasion or convincing.

544
00:21:45,748 --> 00:21:49,084
If you have to beg for it
or force it, it is not consent,

545
00:21:49,118 --> 00:21:51,053
and you're
doing it wrong.

546
00:21:51,086 --> 00:21:52,688
So...

547
00:21:52,722 --> 00:21:55,324
let's learn
how to do it right.

548
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:58,594
There are 11 erogenous zones
on the female body--

549
00:21:58,628 --> 00:22:00,496
the ear, the neck,
the armpit--

550
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:02,264
Wait, what,
the armpits?

551
00:22:02,297 --> 00:22:03,833
Yes.
You wouldn't know that,

552
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:05,668
because like most men,
you go straight for the...

553
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,705
But the nipples
on many women

554
00:22:09,739 --> 00:22:11,907
can be as sensitive
as the clitoris,

555
00:22:11,941 --> 00:22:13,543
so going
straight for them

556
00:22:13,576 --> 00:22:15,077
without any foreplay
to the erogenous zones,

557
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:17,346
can be painful
and overstimulating.

558
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:20,516
The other erogenous zones
can be the stomach,

559
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:23,553
the inner thighs, the feet,
the back of the knees...

560
00:22:23,586 --> 00:22:27,189
Have you ever had someone lick
the back of your knees before?

561
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:29,258
Wouldn't you like
to know?

562
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:30,593
...the more obvious
erogenous zones.

563
00:22:30,626 --> 00:22:33,228
The external
vaginal region...

564
00:22:33,262 --> 00:22:35,598
Wilson,
tell me what you see.

565
00:22:35,631 --> 00:22:38,901
You are draining the cyst to get
access to the torsed ovary.

566
00:22:38,934 --> 00:22:41,270
And I've created a barrier to
prevent spillage

567
00:22:41,303 --> 00:22:43,238
from the cyst's contents
into the abdomen,

568
00:22:43,272 --> 00:22:45,207
in case of malignancy.

569
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,877
Torsion's a rare complication
of cysts,

570
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:49,479
and I used to caution
my patients

571
00:22:49,512 --> 00:22:51,481
from imagining
the worst-case scenario,

572
00:22:51,514 --> 00:22:53,583
but now, after the stripping
of Roe v. Wade,

573
00:22:53,616 --> 00:22:56,085
everything feels like
the worst-case scenario.

574
00:22:56,118 --> 00:22:57,286
Amen to that.

575
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:59,321
I have
constant rage inside.

576
00:22:59,354 --> 00:23:01,123
Yeah, I've thought about going
to one of those places

577
00:23:01,156 --> 00:23:03,258
where you pay money
to destroy things.

578
00:23:03,292 --> 00:23:04,727
Doesn't help.

579
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,128
I also have rage.

580
00:23:06,161 --> 00:23:08,097
I moved to O.B. for joy.

581
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,733
I wanted joy, and now I'm gonna
watch teenage girls die

582
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:13,469
from sticking coat hangers
up inside of themselves.

583
00:23:13,503 --> 00:23:15,237
I mean, what if it's like
the '70s all over again,

584
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,106
and there
are septic wards?

585
00:23:17,139 --> 00:23:18,841
Someone should
make a video

586
00:23:18,874 --> 00:23:20,510
about how dangerous
a coat hanger is.

587
00:23:20,543 --> 00:23:22,512
That's an excellent idea.

588
00:23:22,545 --> 00:23:23,746
There's bleeding here. I don't
know where it's coming from.

589
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:24,947
Lap pad.

590
00:23:29,384 --> 00:23:31,186
Let's extend
the incision.

591
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,956
That exponentially increases
her risk for complications.

592
00:23:33,989 --> 00:23:36,792
She's 17 years old. What if she
wants to have a baby someday?

593
00:23:36,826 --> 00:23:38,928
If the other ovary is torsed
and it doesn't re-perfuse,

594
00:23:38,961 --> 00:23:39,962
this may be all she has.

595
00:23:39,995 --> 00:23:41,030
So, come on, let's go.

596
00:23:41,063 --> 00:23:42,698
Okay.
Now.

597
00:23:47,169 --> 00:23:49,304
Lucia?
I'm Dr. Schmitt.

598
00:23:49,338 --> 00:23:52,107
Dr. Montgomery
is in surgery.

599
00:23:52,141 --> 00:23:53,776
Do you have my results?

600
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:57,479
It's positive.
You're pregnant.

601
00:23:57,513 --> 00:24:00,315
We did it one time.

602
00:24:02,151 --> 00:24:05,955
Did you not think that you could
get pregnant the first time?

603
00:24:05,988 --> 00:24:08,057
I-I'm not stupid.

604
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:12,562
I just didn't think I <i>would</i>
get pregnant the first time.

605
00:24:12,595 --> 00:24:14,664
Do you think that you might want
to keep the pregnancy?

606
00:24:14,697 --> 00:24:16,866
No!
I'm sorry.
I-I have to ask.

607
00:24:16,899 --> 00:24:17,967
I can't have a baby.

608
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,401
I'm a stupid
high schooler

609
00:24:19,434 --> 00:24:21,403
who hasn't fed her fish
since Tuesday.

610
00:24:21,436 --> 00:24:23,238
All I have to do
is put in a pinch of flakes,

611
00:24:23,272 --> 00:24:24,740
and I still
haven't done it.

612
00:24:24,774 --> 00:24:27,209
A kid needs food every day--
real food.

613
00:24:27,242 --> 00:24:29,344
I would be the mother
who forgets to feed her baby,

614
00:24:29,378 --> 00:24:31,413
and I would get arrested
or something.

615
00:24:31,446 --> 00:24:34,016
Oh, my God, I don't want
to be pregnant senior year.

616
00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:35,551
Do you know how mean
kids are?

617
00:24:35,585 --> 00:24:37,419
I do.

618
00:24:37,452 --> 00:24:39,722
I think my parents
might actually murder me.

619
00:24:39,755 --> 00:24:41,724
Hey.

620
00:24:41,757 --> 00:24:44,727
They don't have to know
if you don't want them to.

621
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,429
As long as the embryo measures
under 10 weeks,

622
00:24:47,462 --> 00:24:49,531
you can have
a medical abortion.

623
00:24:49,565 --> 00:24:52,267
We'll give you pills so that
you can manage it at home.

624
00:24:52,301 --> 00:24:55,070
They say it's like a--
like a really bad period.

625
00:24:56,371 --> 00:24:58,841
Yes, please,
get me the pills.

626
00:24:58,874 --> 00:25:00,743
Can we please
just get this over with?

627
00:25:00,776 --> 00:25:01,977
I'll get the ultrasound.

628
00:25:14,323 --> 00:25:18,694
She's calmed down now.
She's with Adams.

629
00:25:18,728 --> 00:25:20,596
Thank you.

630
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:21,597
How long?

631
00:25:21,631 --> 00:25:23,098
Uh, two years.

632
00:25:25,334 --> 00:25:27,803
Gotten a lot worse
the last six months.

633
00:25:27,837 --> 00:25:30,873
My mother
had Alzheimer's.

634
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:32,975
When I was an intern,
she got brought in here

635
00:25:33,008 --> 00:25:34,309
with diverticulitis.

636
00:25:34,343 --> 00:25:35,544
She kept
running out of her room

637
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:37,680
thinking she was late
for surgery.

638
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:45,154
My grandma keeps thinking
I'm my mom.

639
00:25:45,187 --> 00:25:47,657
You must look
a lot like her.

640
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:49,925
Look alike
in some photos.

641
00:25:49,959 --> 00:25:54,063
She died when I...
was born.

642
00:25:54,096 --> 00:25:55,965
I'm sorry.

643
00:25:58,167 --> 00:25:59,935
Now you have to keep
telling your grandmother

644
00:25:59,969 --> 00:26:02,604
over and over that her--
Ooh, I-- I can't do this.

645
00:26:02,638 --> 00:26:06,575
I can't watch this.
I, um...

646
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:09,611
I-I put every effort I could
into matching across the country

647
00:26:09,645 --> 00:26:11,146
so I wouldn't
have to watch this,

648
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,682
and that went to hell,
and now I'm here.

649
00:26:12,715 --> 00:26:15,818
I'm stuck in that house, and...

650
00:26:15,851 --> 00:26:18,453
I love her.
She's my grandmother.

651
00:26:18,487 --> 00:26:21,857
She raised me.
She's why I made it this far.

652
00:26:23,693 --> 00:26:27,529
It might be helpful if you don't
tell her that her daughter died.

653
00:26:27,562 --> 00:26:29,765
I know it's not easy,
but living in her reality

654
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:31,834
is the most humane option.

655
00:26:31,867 --> 00:26:35,037
I don't think
I have it in me.

656
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:38,173
Nobody does.
You'll find it.

657
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:44,546
Is it okay if I stay out here
a little longer? I just...

658
00:26:44,579 --> 00:26:46,215
Of course.

659
00:26:46,248 --> 00:26:47,783
I really feel your pain, Griffith.

660
00:26:47,817 --> 00:26:49,518
My door is always open.

661
00:27:06,268 --> 00:27:09,138
What's going on?
Is Zola okay?

662
00:27:09,171 --> 00:27:11,006
Oh, yeah, she's okay.
She's in there with Amelia.

663
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,674
Okay. I thought she may have had
another panic attack.
No, no.

664
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:15,510
But she did find
some of Kai's puzzles

665
00:27:15,544 --> 00:27:17,679
that they use for
neurological evaluations.

666
00:27:17,713 --> 00:27:20,482
The puzzles mainly focus
on visual-spatial skills.

667
00:27:20,515 --> 00:27:23,318
Yeah, I'm familiar with them.
What-- What's going on?

668
00:27:23,352 --> 00:27:25,320
Meredith, she's aced
every single one

669
00:27:25,354 --> 00:27:27,422
at a level far higher
than most of the adults I see.

670
00:27:27,456 --> 00:27:29,324
I'm aware
that she's smart.

671
00:27:29,358 --> 00:27:31,693
My question is, why is she being
evaluated without my consent?

672
00:27:31,727 --> 00:27:34,663
Right, well, it--
Yeah, it was an accident.

673
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:36,431
Zola discovered the test
when she and I

674
00:27:36,465 --> 00:27:38,500
were in there practicing
on the simulators.

675
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:40,169
She's supposed to be
in my office doing homework.

676
00:27:40,202 --> 00:27:42,271
Mer, based on Kai's time
with her,

677
00:27:42,304 --> 00:27:45,040
Zola is
extremely gifted,

678
00:27:45,074 --> 00:27:46,608
which could explain
the panic attacks.

679
00:27:46,641 --> 00:27:48,443
When giftedness
is undiagnosed,

680
00:27:48,477 --> 00:27:50,445
it can contribute
to behavioral issues--

681
00:27:50,479 --> 00:27:53,082
anxiety, a feeling
of being untethered,

682
00:27:53,115 --> 00:27:55,617
a feeling
that you don't belong.

683
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:58,287
Because you don't.
Her brain does not function
like other kids her age.

684
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,755
She needs challenges
that they don't.

685
00:27:59,789 --> 00:28:02,124
She needs to be around peers
who can relate to her

686
00:28:02,157 --> 00:28:03,392
and the way she thinks.

687
00:28:05,327 --> 00:28:06,395
I'm gonna go see my kid.

688
00:28:11,633 --> 00:28:14,636
Penetration is not necessary
for mutual pleasure.

689
00:28:14,669 --> 00:28:17,272
For starters, most women,
or people with vaginas,

690
00:28:17,306 --> 00:28:20,142
can't achieve orgasm
through penetration.

691
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,278
Yes?
How come
that's not in porn?

692
00:28:23,312 --> 00:28:26,715
Because porn is to actual
human sex

693
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:29,919
as the "Fast & Furious"
is to actual human driving.

694
00:28:29,952 --> 00:28:32,487
That is to say,
it bears no resemblance.

695
00:28:32,521 --> 00:28:34,123
If you are having sex
with your partner,

696
00:28:34,156 --> 00:28:36,291
and you are trying
to make it look like porn,

697
00:28:36,325 --> 00:28:39,761
your partner is experiencing
little to no pleasure.

698
00:28:39,795 --> 00:28:41,563
I would disagree.

699
00:28:41,596 --> 00:28:43,598
Well, you would disagree because
the girls you are with

700
00:28:43,632 --> 00:28:45,634
are also making it look
and sound like porn.

701
00:28:45,667 --> 00:28:47,469
But that is just an act.

702
00:28:47,502 --> 00:28:50,305
A real man wants to give a woman
a real orgasm.

703
00:28:50,339 --> 00:28:52,975
So you want to be a real man
or some candy-ass actor

704
00:28:53,008 --> 00:28:54,743
for whom a woman has
to pretend to enjoy sex?

705
00:28:56,678 --> 00:28:58,280
