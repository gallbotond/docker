1
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,278
It's good to be home.

2
00:03:18,152 --> 00:03:20,285
She's probably not there.

3
00:03:21,024 --> 00:03:22,504
She's there.

4
00:03:22,548 --> 00:03:24,289
Don't you want to go home first?

5
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,552
After.

6
00:03:28,597 --> 00:03:30,425
Suppose she's found
someone else.

7
00:03:30,469 --> 00:03:31,731
She hasn't.

8
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,996
Okay.
Hope you're right.

9
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,302
I am right.

10
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,194
Ferruccio.

11
00:04:16,036 --> 00:04:18,038
This one is good.
Yeah.

12
00:04:25,393 --> 00:04:26,568
Ferruccio!

13
00:04:26,612 --> 00:04:28,614
- Ferruccio! Ferruccio!
- Ferruccio!

14
00:04:28,657 --> 00:04:31,530
- Yes!
- Ferruccio! Ferruccio!

15
00:04:31,573 --> 00:04:35,664
Stop hugging me!
I'm home. I'm not dead!

16
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:38,580
But you're in one piece
and we prayed for that.

17
00:04:59,035 --> 00:05:00,385
Ferruccio.

18
00:05:13,093 --> 00:05:14,224
Careful.

19
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:18,141
It's good. Isn't it?

20
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:20,579
- Fantastic.
- Oh!

21
00:05:22,232 --> 00:05:24,017
Don't touch it.

22
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,366
Okay, miss.

23
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,977
- Okay.

24
00:05:35,028 --> 00:05:36,421
The world has changed.

25
00:05:36,464 --> 00:05:38,858
Farming isn't
everything anymore.

26
00:05:38,901 --> 00:05:41,077
Not in Cento.
Not even Italy.

27
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,472
We find a place in the city.

28
00:05:44,516 --> 00:05:46,474
A little apartment.
And a garage.

29
00:05:46,518 --> 00:05:48,215
What about the farm?

30
00:05:48,258 --> 00:05:50,304
I don't want it, Papa.

31
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:56,005
Give it to them.
They've worked for it.

32
00:05:57,877 --> 00:05:59,705
I have an idea
to start a company.

33
00:05:59,748 --> 00:06:01,446
To build tractors.

34
00:06:02,447 --> 00:06:04,536
Smaller, cheaper tractors

35
00:06:04,579 --> 00:06:07,016
than the ones
that are being made now.

36
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,627
You're a farmer.

37
00:06:10,063 --> 00:06:12,805
You think I was a farmer
in the war, Papa?

38
00:06:12,848 --> 00:06:15,372
I was a mechanic.

39
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,940
I learned about machines,
about cars and engines.

40
00:06:17,984 --> 00:06:19,551
Did I raise a fool?

41
00:06:19,594 --> 00:06:22,641
The only company
that sells tractors in Cento

42
00:06:22,684 --> 00:06:25,861
is Cugini Randi.
Everyone knows that.

43
00:06:25,905 --> 00:06:27,210
But they don't have
the best tractors.

44
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:28,734
They have the only tractors.

45
00:06:28,777 --> 00:06:30,431
If I make a better tractor,
for less money,

46
00:06:30,475 --> 00:06:31,693
people will buy mine.

47
00:06:33,608 --> 00:06:35,480
We have a plan, Papa.

48
00:06:35,523 --> 00:06:38,134
We're going to race
in the Terra dei Motori.

49
00:06:38,178 --> 00:06:41,529
And if we win, when we win,

50
00:06:41,573 --> 00:06:42,791
we'll use the prestige

51
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,880
to raise the money
for the first tractor.

52
00:06:44,924 --> 00:06:47,840
- Who is we?
- Matteo and me.

53
00:06:47,883 --> 00:06:50,930
- Who's Matteo?
- My friend.

54
00:06:50,973 --> 00:06:53,628
- You have a race car?
- We're going to make one.

55
00:06:53,672 --> 00:06:54,760
You can make a car?

56
00:06:54,803 --> 00:06:57,763
We're buying
an old Topolino for nothing.

57
00:06:57,806 --> 00:07:00,809
We're redesigning the engine,
increasing the displacement.

58
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:04,030
Turning the 500cc into a 650cc.

59
00:07:04,073 --> 00:07:08,556
I have also an idea
for a new cylinder head,
with overhead valves.

60
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,732
I can make it with bronze.
Cheap, easy.

61
00:07:12,038 --> 00:07:13,822
It'll be as fast or faster

62
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:15,171
than any car in the race, Papa.

63
00:07:17,565 --> 00:07:19,828
I can do this.

64
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:22,265
I can make the lives
of every farmer like you better.

65
00:07:24,616 --> 00:07:28,533
With a tractor, you can compete
with the big companies.

66
00:07:30,926 --> 00:07:33,276
How do you know
your tractor will work?

67
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,277
We'll make it work.

68
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:35,931
How do you know it'll be cheap?

69
00:07:35,975 --> 00:07:38,151
We'll make it cheap.

70
00:07:38,194 --> 00:07:41,023
Papa, even the government
knows the world has changed.

71
00:07:41,067 --> 00:07:44,244
It's helping new companies
with loans to rebuild Italy.

72
00:07:48,074 --> 00:07:50,642
And if nobody
buys your tractors?

73
00:07:50,685 --> 00:07:54,167
"A man who's not in debt
has no reason to work."

74
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,735
How many times
have you told me that?

75
00:08:00,434 --> 00:08:02,567
It's not impossible
what I'm talking about.

76
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:06,832
The sun rises
and the sun sets for most men,
and they die.

77
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:11,488
But for some, for great men,
their name lives on.

78
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,367
I want the Lamborghini name
to live on.

79
00:08:21,673 --> 00:08:23,979
I want the world
to never forget my name.

80
00:08:25,415 --> 00:08:26,591
Our name.

81
00:08:32,509 --> 00:08:33,728
Our name?

82
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:44,521
This one is not good,
Ferruccio.

83
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,619
You'll throw your life away.

84
00:08:56,751 --> 00:09:00,102
But what better way to do it
than in search of greatness.

85
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,367
Why can't you believe in me?

86
00:09:07,719 --> 00:09:09,721
I believe in what I can see.

87
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,545
Everybody!

88
00:10:43,118 --> 00:10:46,948
Nine, eight, seven, six...

89
00:10:46,992 --> 00:10:52,519
- Ferruccio!
- ...five, four, three,
two, one.

90
00:10:52,562 --> 00:10:55,217
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year.

91
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,354
I want to love you forever...

92
00:11:02,485 --> 00:11:04,923
until time stands still.

93
00:11:06,011 --> 00:11:08,056
Can I do that?

94
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,711
Only forever. No longer.

95
00:11:49,706 --> 00:11:51,143
Ladies and gentlemen,

96
00:11:51,186 --> 00:11:54,189
welcome to
the Terra dei Motori.

97
00:11:54,233 --> 00:11:56,017
The great Enzo Ferrari

98
00:11:56,061 --> 00:11:58,541
will be delivering
the first-place prize

99
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:01,066
to the winner
of the Terra dei Motori

100
00:12:02,937 --> 00:12:06,593
Mr. Ferrari has parted ways
with Alfa Romeo

101
00:12:06,636 --> 00:12:10,249
and will bring his own car

102
00:12:10,292 --> 00:12:12,599
The Ferrari 166 S.

103
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:18,083
Thank you. I'm so proud
of this beautiful car,

104
00:12:18,126 --> 00:12:20,433
- it's like a dream come true.
- What are you doing?

105
00:12:20,476 --> 00:12:24,306
Ferrari. He stands
like he owns the world.

106
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:28,528
To see my cavallino
with my name on my own car,
it's beautiful.

107
00:12:28,571 --> 00:12:30,704
- He does.
- Thank you.

108
00:12:38,581 --> 00:12:40,627
And the race is about to begin.

109
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,455
Ferruccio, come on!

110
00:12:50,898 --> 00:12:53,161
Signor Ferrari
will drop the flag.

111
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,076
- One...
- Okay.

112
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,687
...two... three!

113
00:13:17,272 --> 00:13:18,404
We need more speed!

114
00:13:27,195 --> 00:13:28,805
Go! Go! Go!

115
00:13:46,562 --> 00:13:48,782
Go... go. Go!

116
00:14:00,968 --> 00:14:03,275
After the church,
there are two lanes.

117
00:14:03,318 --> 00:14:04,972
We can overtake them there.

118
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:09,803
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

119
00:14:12,066 --> 00:14:15,678
Number two is trying to pass!

120
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:18,943
- Don't let them pass!
- Just shut up, Ferruccio!

121
00:14:20,596 --> 00:14:22,685
Don't let them pass!

122
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,296
Get ahead of him!
Get ahead of him!

123
00:14:34,219 --> 00:14:36,264
Get ahead of him!
Get ahead of him!

124
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:38,092
It's not wide enough!

125
00:14:38,136 --> 00:14:39,659
Go! Go! Go! Go!

126
00:14:39,702 --> 00:14:42,227
- Take the lane, Matteo!
- There's no room!

127
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,751
Take the lane before the turn!

128
00:14:44,794 --> 00:14:47,275
- We don't have the speed!
- We can beat them!

129
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:49,321
- We will never make it!
- For God's sake!

130
00:14:49,364 --> 00:14:51,105
- What are you doing?

131
00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:53,499
- Are you crazy?

132
00:15:55,909 --> 00:15:57,432
Breakfast.

133
00:16:01,219 --> 00:16:02,350
Breakfast.

134
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,787
- I don't want anything.
- Yes, you do.

135
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:06,311
Ferruccio, breakfast.

136
00:16:10,054 --> 00:16:10,967
We could've won.

137
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,275
We could've won!

138
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:16,408
- We could've died.
- You should have died!

139
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:32,467
What is it, huh?
What's wrong?

140
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,817
We lost the race.

141
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:37,342
Everything we worked for,
it's over.

142
00:16:37,385 --> 00:16:38,952
It's not that.

143
00:16:40,301 --> 00:16:41,520
What are you afraid of?

144
00:16:41,563 --> 00:16:43,261
What?

145
00:16:43,304 --> 00:16:45,001
There's something
wrong with your ears?

146
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:48,875
Yesterday they were fine.
What are you afraid of?

147
00:16:48,918 --> 00:16:52,008
Nothing. All my fears
already came true.

148
00:16:52,835 --> 00:16:54,141
Say it.

149
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:56,752
Say it.

150
00:17:00,495 --> 00:17:02,236
I'm afraid
that I'm not good enough.

151
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:07,241
That I-I did not win the race
not because of Matteo,

152
00:17:07,285 --> 00:17:11,289
but because I did
something wrong,
and I don't know what it was.

153
00:17:12,377 --> 00:17:14,118
That's what scares me the most.

154
00:17:17,338 --> 00:17:19,340
And I don't know
what to do next.

155
00:17:20,341 --> 00:17:22,474
What if I'm a fake?

156
00:17:22,517 --> 00:17:24,867
What if I'm not
who I think I am?

157
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:27,348
What happens then?

158
00:17:27,392 --> 00:17:28,958
You're not a fake.

159
00:17:29,785 --> 00:17:31,178
I believe in you.

160
00:17:31,222 --> 00:17:34,094
I believe in every dream
you've ever had.

161
00:17:34,138 --> 00:17:37,576
And every one of them
will come true.

162
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:39,534
You just haven't found
a way yet.

163
00:17:39,578 --> 00:17:41,841
Eat.

164
00:17:47,586 --> 00:17:51,372
What about
your rowing machine idea?
That was a good one.

165
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:55,463
Nobody needs to lose weight.
All the women got skinny
during the war.

166
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:59,032
I might need one in...

167
00:17:59,075 --> 00:18:03,210
I don't know,
eight, nine months.

168
00:18:06,648 --> 00:18:09,956
I said I might need
a weight loss machine
in about nine months.

169
00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:11,958
I heard you. I was thinking.

170
00:18:12,001 --> 00:18:14,787
She's having a baby,
you fool!

171
00:18:20,836 --> 00:18:23,448
- Really?
- No, I'm joking.

172
00:18:23,491 --> 00:18:25,754
Because it's such a good time
to do that.

173
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:29,932
It's going to be alright.

174
00:18:31,673 --> 00:18:33,284
You'll be a great father.

175
00:18:37,766 --> 00:18:40,247
I think we should
call him Matteo.

176
00:19:31,298 --> 00:19:32,560
Ciao, Papa.

177
00:19:54,582 --> 00:19:55,801
You're okay?

178
00:19:56,715 --> 00:19:58,064
I'm okay.

179
00:19:58,107 --> 00:19:59,500
Huh.

180
00:19:59,544 --> 00:20:00,936
Clelia?

181
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,460
Yes, everything's fine.

182
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:08,379
You want me to help?

183
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,642
You need money?

184
00:20:11,686 --> 00:20:12,731
Yes.

185
00:20:16,212 --> 00:20:17,692
I'll pay it back.

186
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,313
I don't have much.

187
00:20:31,402 --> 00:20:33,186
But I'll give you what I have.

188
00:20:38,844 --> 00:20:40,324
It's not enough, Papa.

189
00:20:41,716 --> 00:20:43,588
I have an idea.
It will be hard.

190
00:20:44,632 --> 00:20:46,504
But it will work.

191
00:20:46,547 --> 00:20:49,202
This time I know it will work.

192
00:20:49,245 --> 00:20:51,378
I promise.

193
00:20:51,422 --> 00:20:54,512
If you do this,
I'll pay it back with interest.

194
00:20:56,035 --> 00:20:57,210
Interest?

195
00:20:58,472 --> 00:20:59,517
Yes.

196
00:22:07,889 --> 00:22:09,413
He mortgaged the farm?

197
00:22:12,459 --> 00:22:14,243
You asked him to do this?

198
00:22:14,287 --> 00:22:15,854
He's my father.

199
00:22:15,897 --> 00:22:19,640
He's a husband to your mother
and a father to your brothers.

200
00:22:19,684 --> 00:22:21,207
I'll pay it back.

201
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,861
That's not the point.

202
00:22:22,904 --> 00:22:25,037
It is not his to give you.

203
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,170
It is your brothers'.
It is their farm.

204
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:31,043
They worked for it.
Their whole lives
they worked for it.

205
00:22:31,086 --> 00:22:34,655
You said it yourself.
They deserve it.

206
00:22:34,699 --> 00:22:36,222
You don't believe in me?

207
00:22:36,265 --> 00:22:38,833
I believe in you, Ferruccio.

208
00:22:38,877 --> 00:22:41,401
I believe in you more than
you believe in yourself.

209
00:22:42,489 --> 00:22:44,143
But we will find another way.

210
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:48,277
This is selfish.

211
00:22:48,321 --> 00:22:51,237
You will not put the future
of your family in danger.

212
00:22:53,282 --> 00:22:55,937
They have their own dreams.

213
00:22:55,981 --> 00:22:58,070
I would never let them
lose their farm.

214
00:22:58,113 --> 00:22:59,767
Things go wrong.

215
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:02,944
No matter your intentions,
things go wrong.

216
00:23:03,902 --> 00:23:06,600
Don't do this, Ferruccio!

217
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:10,778
No good will come of it,
I can feel it.

218
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:16,175
He only gave it to you
because you asked him.

219
00:23:16,218 --> 00:23:17,742
He gave it to me
because he believes in me.

220
00:23:17,785 --> 00:23:20,484
No. Because he pities you.

221
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:26,402
Give it back.

222
00:23:30,102 --> 00:23:33,584
He won't take it back.
I know him.

223
00:23:33,627 --> 00:23:38,719
Then you go to
the bank yourself,
and deposit it in his account.

224
00:24:20,195 --> 00:24:21,762
I'll take the next customer.

225
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:30,205
Ferruccio! It's Vito.
Vito Rossi!

226
00:24:30,249 --> 00:24:31,598
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

227
00:24:31,642 --> 00:24:32,991
- How've you been?
- Good.

228
00:24:33,034 --> 00:24:35,210
How's your father?
Your brothers?

229
00:24:35,254 --> 00:24:36,560
Very good.
Everybody's good.

230
00:24:36,603 --> 00:24:38,518
Excellent. Have a seat.

231
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:41,695
So, what can I do for you?

232
00:24:41,739 --> 00:24:43,436
I'd like to open an account.

233
00:24:43,479 --> 00:24:44,698
Of course.

234
00:24:46,787 --> 00:24:48,572
In your name, I assume.

235
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:53,968
Ferruccio in what name
would you like the account.

236
00:24:55,666 --> 00:24:58,756
My name... Ferruccio.

237
00:24:59,757 --> 00:25:02,498
Ferruccio Lamborghini.

238
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:04,283
- Great.

239
00:25:04,326 --> 00:25:05,937
Can I smoke a cigarette?

240
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,199
Of course.

241
00:25:19,124 --> 00:25:21,387
- Take that...
- Okay.

242
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:06,780
Carioca.
That's what we call it.

243
00:26:06,824 --> 00:26:10,001
- Hm.
- Small enough for a farmer
to use anywhere,

244
00:26:10,044 --> 00:26:12,830
and strong enough
for any company to want.

245
00:26:12,873 --> 00:26:16,268
With this kind of power,
it will take a lot of gasoline.

246
00:26:16,311 --> 00:26:20,707
We start with the Morris
four-cylinder 1548 cc.

247
00:26:20,751 --> 00:26:24,058
Yeah, of course.
What we talked about.

248
00:26:24,102 --> 00:26:26,626
Here's what
we didn't talk about.

249
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:29,324
- Two fuel tanks?
- Yes.

250
00:26:29,368 --> 00:26:30,717
Oh, fuck.

251
00:26:31,979 --> 00:26:32,937
Listen...

252
00:26:35,069 --> 00:26:36,767
- we start on gasoline.
- Mm-hm.

253
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:39,726
But when the exhaust manifold
warms enough,

254
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:44,688
we can cut off the gasoline
and release petroleum
from this tank.

255
00:26:44,731 --> 00:26:51,390
Maybe. The coil
would have to be hot enough
to vaporize the petroleum

256
00:26:51,433 --> 00:26:53,784
before it gets into
the carburetor.

257
00:26:53,827 --> 00:26:56,177
That's why
it'll be a copper coil.

258
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:01,966
So, two types of fuel.
One cheap, one expensive.

259
00:27:02,009 --> 00:27:03,619
And a copper coil.

260
00:27:04,795 --> 00:27:06,100
Exactly.

261
00:27:07,623 --> 00:27:09,713
I don't know.
Can it work?

262
00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:12,106
Of course it can work.

263
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:15,240
- How do you know?
- We make it work.

264
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,897
- A hybrid?
- Mm-hm.

265
00:27:20,811 --> 00:27:22,638
That-that's exciting.

266
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,728
A hybrid for our Carioca.

267
00:27:24,771 --> 00:27:26,860
- Carioca.
- Carioca.

268
00:27:26,904 --> 00:27:28,732
Ah, fuck!

269
00:27:37,871 --> 00:27:38,829
This one.

270
00:27:40,221 --> 00:27:41,179
Hm?

271
00:27:44,356 --> 00:27:46,140
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

272
00:27:46,184 --> 00:27:47,663
Okay.

273
00:27:49,883 --> 00:27:51,798
So, it's for sale?

274
00:27:51,842 --> 00:27:53,191
Make a bid.

275
00:28:08,423 --> 00:28:09,773
Keep going.

276
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:11,775
Right.

277
00:28:15,866 --> 00:28:17,302
Okay.

278
00:28:24,091 --> 00:28:25,963
Is that it?

279
00:28:26,006 --> 00:28:27,094
Fuck!

280
00:28:41,021 --> 00:28:41,892
Wow.

281
00:28:44,329 --> 00:28:45,243
Wow.

282
00:28:50,465 --> 00:28:51,379
Alright.

283
00:29:43,605 --> 00:29:45,607
Here she comes again.

284
00:29:45,651 --> 00:29:48,349
- Different color
head band today?
- Yes.

285
00:29:52,614 --> 00:29:53,702
Good morning.

286
00:29:53,746 --> 00:29:54,878
Morning.

287
00:29:57,968 --> 00:29:59,752
Oh, she's beautiful.

288
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,407
She smiled at you.

289
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:04,713
She said good morning to you.

290
00:30:04,757 --> 00:30:05,889
Go say hello.

291
00:30:06,672 --> 00:30:08,152
Why should I?

292
00:30:08,195 --> 00:30:09,631
Because you like her?

293
00:30:12,069 --> 00:30:15,072
Maybe she doesn't like me.

294
00:30:15,115 --> 00:30:17,857
You'll never know
if you don't talk to her.

295
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:19,467
It's not that hard.
You...

296
00:30:19,511 --> 00:30:24,255
You go over, you let your
mouth move and it says, "Hello."

297
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:26,779
Okay.

298
00:30:26,822 --> 00:30:27,998
Ferruccio!

299
00:30:28,041 --> 00:30:29,129
Where are you going?!

300
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:33,917
- Hi.
- Hi.

301
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,180
- Ferruccio.
- Annita. Nice to meet you.

302
00:30:38,356 --> 00:30:40,793
Okay.

303
00:30:46,755 --> 00:30:50,063
Annita, say hello
to my friend, Matteo.

304
00:30:50,107 --> 00:30:52,587
- Hi.
- Hi.

305
00:30:56,765 --> 00:30:59,899
What he meant to say is,
"Why don't you sit down
and join us?"

306
00:30:59,943 --> 00:31:02,684
Oh, I can't,
I will be late for school.

307
00:31:05,078 --> 00:31:06,514
What-what do you study?

308
00:31:06,558 --> 00:31:08,212
- Economics.
- Oh.

309
00:31:11,824 --> 00:31:16,307
And Matteo's the greatest
race car driver
that the world has ever known.

310
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:21,094
He knows more about engines
than anyone else.

311
00:31:21,138 --> 00:31:23,053
- Really?
- No.

312
00:31:26,186 --> 00:31:27,883
Thanks for the pastry.

313
00:31:35,804 --> 00:31:37,241
She likes you.

314
00:31:37,284 --> 00:31:40,157
Because I talked to her.

315
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,029
If you are as good with tractors
as you are with women,

316
00:31:43,073 --> 00:31:44,683
oh, we are going to be
very rich.

317
00:31:44,726 --> 00:31:46,990
I only need one woman.

318
00:31:47,686 --> 00:31:49,340
Yeah. Me too.

319
00:31:51,037 --> 00:31:52,212
Don't give up.

320
00:31:52,256 --> 00:31:54,475
We only lose when we give up.
Alright?

321
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:56,434
Alright, alright.

322
00:32:13,103 --> 00:32:16,932
I love you.
More than anything, I love you.

323
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:19,631
I know.

324
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:26,812
- Okay, hold it. Okay.
- Okay.

325
00:32:32,122 --> 00:32:34,907
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Okay.

326
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:36,474
- Okay?
- Yes.

327
00:32:47,572 --> 00:32:49,095
Wave, stupid.

328
00:32:54,883 --> 00:32:55,971
Okay.

329
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:00,628
Look. Look here. Look.

330
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,500
- Really?

331
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,590
Stop, stop, stop.

332
00:33:05,633 --> 00:33:07,853
- Yes, yes.
- No, no, no.

333
00:33:07,896 --> 00:33:10,160
No, no, no!

334
00:33:10,203 --> 00:33:11,944
- My God--

335
00:33:31,181 --> 00:33:32,486
Okay.

336
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,198
He's close, isn't he?

337
00:33:49,155 --> 00:33:51,462
Yes. Tomorrow.

338
00:33:54,595 --> 00:33:56,249
Don't come home late.

339
00:33:58,382 --> 00:33:59,818
Okay?

340
00:33:59,861 --> 00:34:02,125
Promise me.

341
00:34:02,168 --> 00:34:03,474
I promise.

342
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:01,358
Gianni, I can't be late. Gianni.

343
00:35:40,223 --> 00:35:41,311
<i>Hello?</i>

344
00:36:09,643 --> 00:36:13,038
She was bleeding,
I called the hospital.
They took her.

345
00:36:23,178 --> 00:36:25,442
- Push, Clelia. Push, Clelia.

346
00:36:25,485 --> 00:36:27,357
- Okay.
- The baby's coming.

347
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,662
- He's coming.
- Again.

348
00:36:28,706 --> 00:36:30,708
It's coming.
It's coming. Breathe.

349
00:36:30,751 --> 00:36:32,318
- Push, Clelia.

350
00:36:32,362 --> 00:36:35,278
Good. Breathe and push.

351
00:36:37,976 --> 00:36:39,586
- Push.

352
00:36:41,893 --> 00:36:43,982
She's getting the paper!
She's bleeding!

353
00:36:44,025 --> 00:36:45,288
Forceps!

354
00:36:45,331 --> 00:36:51,294
Ferruccio! Ferruccio!

355
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:07,135
Can I help you?

356
00:37:07,788 --> 00:37:09,181
My wife is here!

357
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:33,205
How is Clelia?

358
00:37:33,248 --> 00:37:36,164
The baby is fine.
It's a beautiful boy.

359
00:37:36,208 --> 00:37:37,644
Where is my wife?

360
00:37:39,167 --> 00:37:40,517
There was a problem.

361
00:37:51,571 --> 00:37:53,530
We weren't able
to stop the bleeding.

362
00:39:44,118 --> 00:39:47,687
We need to set a date
for the baby, for the baptism.

363
00:39:47,731 --> 00:39:49,341
Yes.

364
00:39:49,384 --> 00:39:51,386
You need to think about
other things now.

365
00:39:53,476 --> 00:39:54,520
Of course.

366
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:59,612
May the seeds of the fruit
be planted with goodwill.

367
00:39:59,656 --> 00:40:01,962
And the harvest will be rich.

368
00:40:12,364 --> 00:40:13,800
- Ferruccio.
- Vito.

369
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:17,543
So sorry about your wife.

370
00:40:17,587 --> 00:40:19,937
I have a proposition for you.

371
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:25,029
If I built a tractor
half that size

372
00:40:25,072 --> 00:40:27,901
but twice as strong,
and half the cost to operate,

373
00:40:27,945 --> 00:40:30,861
would your bank invest
in a thousand of them?

374
00:40:34,952 --> 00:40:36,649
Have you built such a tractor?

375
00:41:24,784 --> 00:41:27,831
To the future
of the Lamborghini tractor.

376
00:41:27,874 --> 00:41:30,137
- We did it.
- We did it.

377
00:41:37,362 --> 00:41:39,103
She should be here with us.

378
00:41:40,626 --> 00:41:43,368
- To Clelia.
- To Clelia.

379
00:41:47,677 --> 00:41:48,678
Look who's here.

380
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:58,557
I'm crazy about her, Ferruccio.

381
00:41:58,601 --> 00:42:01,429
I see her face
when I close my eyes to sleep,

382
00:42:01,473 --> 00:42:03,649
and it's there
when I open them to wake.

383
00:42:04,476 --> 00:42:05,999
You're in love.

384
00:42:06,043 --> 00:42:07,740
I'm in love.

385
00:42:07,784 --> 00:42:12,179
Go get her.
Tomorrow it may be too late.

386
00:42:19,404 --> 00:42:20,492
I have to go.

387
00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:24,191
Go? Where are you going?

388
00:42:24,235 --> 00:42:25,366
I'm sorry.

389
00:42:27,717 --> 00:42:30,241
- Talk to her.
- Yeah.

390
00:43:02,926 --> 00:43:04,710
Did my friend talk to you?

391
00:43:04,754 --> 00:43:05,798
He did.

392
00:43:06,886 --> 00:43:08,583
He doesn't catch my eye.

393
00:43:09,715 --> 00:43:10,847
You do.

394
00:43:11,674 --> 00:43:12,936
But you know that.

395
00:43:12,979 --> 00:43:15,329
Give him a chance.

396
00:43:15,373 --> 00:43:17,070
Why should I do that?

397
00:43:18,463 --> 00:43:20,378
Because he deserves one.

398
00:43:20,421 --> 00:43:21,945
So do I.

399
00:43:27,907 --> 00:43:29,300
My wife died.

400
00:43:30,257 --> 00:43:33,521
I know. What was her name?

401
00:43:34,435 --> 00:43:35,698
Clelia.

402
00:43:36,916 --> 00:43:38,004
She was beautiful.

403
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:39,919
She was everything.

404
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:44,010
Don't sit.

405
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:47,231
If you do, I will let you.

406
00:43:49,799 --> 00:43:53,237
I'll only take
what you have to give me
because I need it.

407
00:43:55,282 --> 00:43:57,502
And some day
you will hate me for it.

408
00:43:58,982 --> 00:43:59,896
No.

409
00:44:02,855 --> 00:44:05,858
I won't. Never.

410
00:44:40,414 --> 00:44:42,199
You just want more.

411
00:44:43,287 --> 00:44:45,680
You always want more.

412
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:47,508
You want me to say I'm sorry?

413
00:44:47,552 --> 00:44:49,684
I'm sorry.

414
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:52,035
Where is your shame, Ferruccio?

415
00:44:55,865 --> 00:44:57,692
I wanted to say it's Clelia,

416
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:59,564
that her death has changed you,

417
00:44:59,607 --> 00:45:02,262
but in my heart
I know that is not true.

418
00:45:02,306 --> 00:45:05,004
This is who you are.
Who you've always been.

419
00:45:05,048 --> 00:45:06,832
Tonino needs a mother.

420
00:45:06,876 --> 00:45:08,747
So, yes,
I took her because I could.

421
00:45:08,791 --> 00:45:11,184
Think about what I just said
Matteo, because I could.

422
00:45:11,228 --> 00:45:13,447
If I didn't take her,
someone else would have.

423
00:45:13,491 --> 00:45:16,711
I'm sorry, but she was never
going to be yours.

424
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:20,150
How can I hurt my friend
by taking something
that he never had?

425
00:45:24,371 --> 00:45:26,069
Don't let this change things,
Matteo.

426
00:45:29,507 --> 00:45:30,508
I need you.

427
00:45:31,639 --> 00:45:33,641
I've always needed you.

428
00:45:33,685 --> 00:45:35,513
Clelia knew that.

429
00:45:35,556 --> 00:45:37,558
Clelia was the smart one.

430
00:45:39,386 --> 00:45:42,302
She said nothing good
could come of this,

431
00:45:43,129 --> 00:45:44,609
and look what happened.

432
00:45:50,093 --> 00:45:52,965
I want 25 percent
of the company.

433
00:45:54,749 --> 00:45:56,316
The rest is yours.

434
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,178
<i>Tre mignon.</i>

435
00:46:39,185 --> 00:46:40,360
<i>Due cornetti.</i>

436
00:46:42,449 --> 00:46:45,409
One Sacher torte,
in its own box.

437
00:46:47,672 --> 00:46:49,152
Thank you.

438
00:47:03,209 --> 00:47:04,123
Ciao Bella.

439
00:47:17,658 --> 00:47:20,139
- Is Annita in the office?
- She is.

440
00:47:21,575 --> 00:47:23,186
- Red or blue?
- Red.

441
00:47:23,229 --> 00:47:27,407
- Not blue?
- Definitely red.
Definitely red.

442
00:47:27,451 --> 00:47:29,105
Who screwed up?

443
00:47:29,148 --> 00:47:31,237
It wasn't us.

444
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:32,978
Ferruccio!

445
00:47:37,113 --> 00:47:38,549
Go see what she wants.

446
00:47:38,592 --> 00:47:39,724
Not me.

447
00:47:39,767 --> 00:47:40,986
You're a coward.

448
00:47:50,648 --> 00:47:52,345
You look beautiful this morning.

449
00:47:52,389 --> 00:47:54,478
I'm sorry I had to leave early.

450
00:47:54,521 --> 00:47:57,002
Did I mention you
look beautiful this morning?

451
00:48:00,049 --> 00:48:03,574
Every time you buy pastries
it costs us money.

452
00:48:03,617 --> 00:48:05,097
Well, take it from my salary.

453
00:48:05,141 --> 00:48:07,491
You forget, I own the company.

454
00:48:07,534 --> 00:48:08,709
Is that so?

455
00:48:09,797 --> 00:48:12,148
Mrs. Giambini called.

456
00:48:12,191 --> 00:48:14,541
Who's-who's Giambini?

457
00:48:14,585 --> 00:48:15,978
She isn't happy
with her tractor?

458
00:48:16,021 --> 00:48:18,893
No, she is unhappy with Tonino.

459
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:21,070
She's his teacher.

460
00:48:21,113 --> 00:48:23,463
Tesoro, you have to spend
more time with him.

461
00:48:23,507 --> 00:48:24,856
I give him everything.

462
00:48:24,899 --> 00:48:27,598
Yes, you give him money,
clothes, cars.

463
00:48:27,641 --> 00:48:29,643
But of yourself?

464
00:48:29,687 --> 00:48:32,516
That's what he really wants.

465
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:35,519
You know he is as smart
as you are, but he's failing.

466
00:48:35,562 --> 00:48:37,782
I'll talk to him.

467
00:48:37,825 --> 00:48:40,611
My friend Diego
has a new exhibit.

468
00:48:40,654 --> 00:48:43,483
- I hate your friend Diego.

469
00:48:43,527 --> 00:48:45,572
We should go, bring Tonino.

470
00:48:45,616 --> 00:48:48,010
Spend some time together
as a family.

471
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,326
Goddamn clutch!

472
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:03,416
Tonino, it never works.

473
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,509
What do you think?

474
00:49:09,553 --> 00:49:10,858
About what?

475
00:49:11,859 --> 00:49:12,730
The boat.

476
00:49:12,773 --> 00:49:14,949
It's a present for you.

477
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:17,126
Because I failed
all my subjects?

478
00:49:18,257 --> 00:49:20,172
- Yes.
- What happens next?

479
00:49:20,216 --> 00:49:23,219
We get in the boat,
you take me out to sea,
and throw me overboard?

480
00:49:26,135 --> 00:49:28,180
Come. Sit.

481
00:49:29,834 --> 00:49:30,704
Sit.

482
00:49:37,146 --> 00:49:39,539
Tonino, life is short.

483
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:43,065
When one is young,
when one is beautiful,
like yourself,

484
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:46,068
there are more important
things than grades.

485
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:48,592
Like my mother?

486
00:49:50,985 --> 00:49:52,422
Like her.

487
00:49:52,465 --> 00:49:54,641
You still miss her, don't you?

488
00:49:56,165 --> 00:49:57,296
Yes.

489
00:49:58,645 --> 00:50:00,908
Why?

490
00:50:00,952 --> 00:50:03,259
Because she was beautiful,
like you.

491
00:50:03,302 --> 00:50:05,826
Is that why you
miss her so much?

492
00:50:15,793 --> 00:50:18,056
I miss her so much
because she was the kindest

493
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:21,190
and the smartest person
I ever met.

494
00:50:22,713 --> 00:50:24,106
She understood
better than anyone

495
00:50:24,149 --> 00:50:27,152
the difference between
right and wrong.

496
00:50:27,196 --> 00:50:29,328
And for a lot of people
that's not so easy.

497
00:50:30,764 --> 00:50:32,244
She always did the right thing.

498
00:50:33,506 --> 00:50:35,204
She made it look easy.

499
00:50:38,163 --> 00:50:40,557
Annita's pretty great, too.

500
00:50:43,168 --> 00:50:44,256
She is.

501
00:50:49,218 --> 00:50:51,524
If your grades don't improve,
I'll buy you a Ferrari.

502
00:51:09,325 --> 00:51:10,761
Good day, mate.

503
00:51:10,804 --> 00:51:12,284
I'm looking for a job.

504
00:51:12,328 --> 00:51:14,112
Any inkling
on who I might see?

505
00:51:14,156 --> 00:51:18,334
Everyone's gone home.
Come back tomorrow.

506
00:51:18,377 --> 00:51:20,988
That's a pretty flash motor
you're working on there!

507
00:51:21,032 --> 00:51:23,643
- Australian?
- Nah, Kiwi.

508
00:51:23,687 --> 00:51:27,169
- What do you do?
- Anything needed for a car.

509
00:51:27,212 --> 00:51:31,085
I came here to turn a wrench.
I love the Italian motors, mate.

510
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:33,262
Yeah, called in on Maserati,
Fiat, Ferrari,

511
00:51:33,305 --> 00:51:35,133
they all told me to piss off.

512
00:51:35,177 --> 00:51:36,395
What are we working on?

513
00:51:37,701 --> 00:51:38,876
Bad clutch.

514
00:51:48,712 --> 00:51:51,932
Whoever's been driving that car
needs a lesson or three.

515
00:51:51,976 --> 00:51:54,935
It's not the driver.
It's the clutch.

516
00:51:54,979 --> 00:51:56,981
Would that be
a matter of opinion?

517
00:51:59,766 --> 00:52:01,507
I want to modify
the tractor clutch,

518
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:03,466
to use in the Ferrari.

519
00:52:03,509 --> 00:52:07,470
In your opinion,
what do I have to do?

520
00:52:07,513 --> 00:52:10,299
The disc and the plates
are pretty much the same.

521
00:52:11,604 --> 00:52:14,259
More than enough space
to mount it.

522
00:52:14,303 --> 00:52:16,000
I'd say you don't have to do
a bloody thing,

523
00:52:16,043 --> 00:52:17,393
you just put
the new clutch in.

524
00:52:17,436 --> 00:52:20,874
- I agree.
- I'll give a hand.

525
00:52:21,701 --> 00:52:22,963
What's your name?

526
00:52:23,007 --> 00:52:25,705
Wallace.
Bob Wallace. Yours?

527
00:52:25,749 --> 00:52:28,578
Ferruccio Lamborghini.

528
00:52:32,016 --> 00:52:34,061
You have a-a car?

529
00:52:34,105 --> 00:52:35,193
Yeah.

530
00:52:35,976 --> 00:52:37,021
You a good driver?

531
00:52:37,064 --> 00:52:38,152
Yeah, I'm the best
in New Zealand.

532
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:40,372
Oh. What about Italy?

533
00:52:40,416 --> 00:52:42,461
If that was a job offer,
I'll take it.

534
00:52:46,639 --> 00:52:47,727
Come.

535
00:52:56,214 --> 00:53:00,218
I think everything
that they said is good to do.
It's good.

536
00:53:00,262 --> 00:53:03,743
Can you tell him?
Give him my very best.

537
00:53:03,787 --> 00:53:05,310
Signor Ferrari.

538
00:53:05,354 --> 00:53:08,879
Just a moment.
Good night.

539
00:53:08,922 --> 00:53:11,229
Forgive me,
if I could have a moment.

540
00:53:11,273 --> 00:53:13,318
Ferruccio Lamborghini.
How do you do, sir?

541
00:53:14,276 --> 00:53:15,538
What can I do for you?

542
00:53:15,581 --> 00:53:17,496
If I may, in my opinion,

543
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:19,324
- you make the best cars
in the world.
- Oh.

544
00:53:19,368 --> 00:53:23,110
I have seven of them.
One for every day of the week.

545
00:53:23,154 --> 00:53:25,330
Well, there should be
more days in the week.

546
00:53:25,374 --> 00:53:27,941
More buyers like yourself.
Nice to meet you.

547
00:53:27,985 --> 00:53:32,337
I have a 250 GT Coupé,
a Pininfarina.

548
00:53:32,381 --> 00:53:34,208
I have a 250 GT Bayoneta.

549
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:36,559
- It's a great car.
I like it very much.
- Mm-hm.

550
00:53:36,602 --> 00:53:40,345
- I even bought a 250
- GT 2+2.
All great.

551
00:53:40,389 --> 00:53:44,436
But with all my Ferraris,
there is a problem.

552
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,309
The clutch.
They're all bad.

553
00:53:50,964 --> 00:53:54,228
Ferruccio Lamborghini.
You know who I am?

554
00:53:54,751 --> 00:53:55,752
Oh, yes.

555
00:53:55,795 --> 00:53:57,667
You make tractors.

556
00:53:57,710 --> 00:53:59,451
And air conditioning
and heating.

557
00:53:59,495 --> 00:54:03,020
Ah.
I've got a dinner appointment.

558
00:54:03,063 --> 00:54:06,502
Forgive me, but your clutch
does not live up to your car.

559
00:54:08,068 --> 00:54:09,896
I come as a friend.

560
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:12,986
I'm sure you know this,
I'm not the first
to point it out.

561
00:54:14,379 --> 00:54:15,815
I have a solution.

562
00:54:15,859 --> 00:54:17,556
If you'd consider a partnership.

563
00:54:18,427 --> 00:54:21,734
Ferrari and Lamborghini.

564
00:54:21,778 --> 00:54:23,867
We'll make the best cars
in the world.

565
00:54:25,608 --> 00:54:27,871
Go back to your tractors,
farmer.

566
00:54:34,181 --> 00:54:36,532
You're stealing from people.

567
00:54:36,575 --> 00:54:38,708
You're charging ten times
what it costs me

568
00:54:38,751 --> 00:54:40,536
to put a better clutch
in my tractors.

569
00:54:40,579 --> 00:54:42,625
You know what they say
about Lamborghini?

570
00:54:44,017 --> 00:54:46,716
That he's too uneducated
to understand

571
00:54:46,759 --> 00:54:47,978
what he doesn't know.

572
00:54:58,771 --> 00:55:01,905
So, not to state the obvious,
but he's a prick
of the first order.

573
00:55:01,948 --> 00:55:03,210
Isn't he?

574
00:55:03,254 --> 00:55:04,777
I don't like the way
the man talks,

575
00:55:04,821 --> 00:55:06,039
don't like the way he dresses,

576
00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:09,652
don't like his smile,
or lack thereof.

577
00:55:09,695 --> 00:55:11,393
You already have the job.

578
00:55:12,872 --> 00:55:15,005
It doesn't change the truth
of what is.

579
00:55:51,302 --> 00:55:54,261
The Miura is the fiercest
and most cunning of all bulls.

580
00:55:54,305 --> 00:55:56,699
But this matador
is the champion.

581
00:55:58,004 --> 00:55:59,571
Life and death, Tonino.

582
00:55:59,615 --> 00:56:01,704
This is what bullfighting
is all about.

583
00:56:07,492 --> 00:56:11,844
Some people turn away,
others watch and learn.

584
00:56:11,888 --> 00:56:14,281
I want the bull to win.

585
00:56:14,325 --> 00:56:16,327
Me too.
But it doesn't happen often.

586
00:56:18,851 --> 00:56:22,551
Tonino, look at the faces
of the people.

587
00:56:22,594 --> 00:56:26,076
The matador kills the beast,
or the beast kills the matador.

588
00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:29,296
That moment will live forever
in the hearts of the people
watching.

589
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:31,473
Why doesn't he run away?

590
00:56:31,516 --> 00:56:33,997
Because he is a champion.

591
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:39,437
It's fascinating, isn't it?

592
00:56:39,481 --> 00:56:43,572
The bull is everything.
So unforgettable.

593
00:56:44,921 --> 00:56:46,357
What are you thinking?

594
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,403
I'm thinking of a car.

595
00:56:51,188 --> 00:56:52,929
A car that doesn't exist yet.

596
00:56:52,972 --> 00:56:54,321
One that is as
strong and powerful

597
00:56:54,365 --> 00:56:56,236
and as unforgettable
as the bull.

598
00:56:59,413 --> 00:57:01,067
I'm going to build it.

599
00:57:02,155 --> 00:57:03,505
A car?

600
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:13,079
Coffee, gentlemen?

601
00:57:13,123 --> 00:57:15,168
Hi. Yes, please.

602
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:19,782
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

603
00:57:24,787 --> 00:57:26,745
I come get you later.

604
00:57:27,877 --> 00:57:30,880
Perfect. Have a good day.

605
00:57:34,013 --> 00:57:38,757
So, this is my idea.
How long will it take?

606
00:57:38,801 --> 00:57:41,368
How long? It can't be done.

607
00:57:43,936 --> 00:57:46,417
How long do you
think it will take?

608
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:49,246
As much as I hate to agree
with Mr. Bizzarrini,
I think he's right.

609
00:57:51,944 --> 00:57:53,772
This? This can't be done.

610
00:57:54,773 --> 00:57:55,948
You agree?

611
00:57:57,167 --> 00:57:59,038
I actually love
what you're asking.

612
00:57:59,082 --> 00:58:01,345
It's new and I'll design it.

613
00:58:03,434 --> 00:58:05,175
But engineering
is their department,

614
00:58:05,218 --> 00:58:07,394
if they think it's impossible,
who am I to argue?

615
00:58:07,438 --> 00:58:09,614
What I can say,
I can't design a car

616
00:58:09,658 --> 00:58:11,398
if I don't know
the specifications,

617
00:58:11,442 --> 00:58:12,878
and it's something
that needs to be decided.

618
00:58:12,922 --> 00:58:15,577
It is decided. It's right here.

619
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:18,536
This is the car to make
the world forget about Ferrari.

620
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:20,059
Ferruccio, please.

621
00:58:20,103 --> 00:58:22,888
A V12 touring car
double camshaft,

622
00:58:22,932 --> 00:58:25,891
dry sump lubrication,
five speed transmission.

623
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:29,286
A limited slip differential,
two ignition coils
instead of one?

624
00:58:29,329 --> 00:58:31,331
Six twin-choke carburetors.

625
00:58:31,375 --> 00:58:34,813
It's impossible to fit all
of this in a 3.5 liter engine.

626
00:58:34,857 --> 00:58:37,468
No, it must be a 3.5,
four liter is too heavy.

627
00:58:37,511 --> 00:58:40,602
We need the power
but we need the speed, too.

628
00:58:40,645 --> 00:58:43,866
The Lamborghini 350 GT has to be
as fast as a racing car.

629
00:58:43,909 --> 00:58:46,390
The man wants to defy
the laws of physics.

630
00:58:46,433 --> 00:58:48,610
Are you listening?
Either you're a carmaker

631
00:58:48,653 --> 00:58:50,046
or you are a dreamer, Ferruccio.

632
00:58:50,089 --> 00:58:52,396
Please, we all have
families here.

633
00:58:52,439 --> 00:58:54,920
We all quit our job
to come work for you.

634
00:58:54,964 --> 00:58:57,183
We all believe in you,
we all believe in your ideas
but--

635
00:58:57,227 --> 00:59:00,709
What if instead of cast-iron
we make an aluminum engine?

636
00:59:00,752 --> 00:59:02,406
I know you are
the new genius in town,

637
00:59:02,449 --> 00:59:05,452
but people have been
trying this for years.

638
00:59:05,496 --> 00:59:07,106
Aluminum can't
withstand the heat.

639
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:10,153
What if we keep
certain parts cast-iron?

640
00:59:10,196 --> 00:59:13,460
The valves, the cylinders,
the combustion chamber.

641
00:59:13,504 --> 00:59:16,202
That's something new,
I don't know
if this would work.

642
00:59:16,246 --> 00:59:17,682
But we can try it.

643
00:59:17,726 --> 00:59:19,684
It could be as much as
half the weight of the engine.

644
00:59:19,728 --> 00:59:21,555
- At least.
- And the engine,

645
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:23,993
maybe we can change it
from dry sump to wet sump.

646
00:59:24,036 --> 00:59:26,909
I need to build a chassis
to accommodate
a double camshaft.

647
00:59:26,952 --> 00:59:28,998
- Good.
- And the carburetors?

648
00:59:29,041 --> 00:59:30,695
A rear stabilizer bow
would help.

649
00:59:30,739 --> 00:59:33,219
Great. Great.
And it has to be ready to unveil

650
00:59:33,263 --> 00:59:36,309
- in the Geneva Motor Show.
- That's very tight.

651
00:59:36,353 --> 00:59:38,485
- I think we can do it.
- It's 18 months.

652
00:59:38,529 --> 00:59:41,880
No, no. Six months.
Geneva is March 21st.

653
00:59:41,924 --> 00:59:44,187
- Geneva this year?
- Yes.

654
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:47,103
- You want to do Geneva
in six months?
- Oh, yes.

655
00:59:47,146 --> 00:59:49,496
Ferruccio, please,
you're talking like a madman,
seriously.

656
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:52,195
Why would you ask me
to design an automobile
in six months

657
00:59:52,238 --> 00:59:54,023
that doesn't yet have
an engine or a chassis?

658
00:59:54,066 --> 00:59:55,502
In six months, in Geneva,

659
00:59:55,546 --> 00:59:58,114
people will be looking for
the next Ferrari.

660
00:59:58,157 --> 01:00:00,333
What they will find
is the first Lamborghini.

661
01:00:00,377 --> 01:00:02,988
The Lamborghini 350 GT.

662
01:00:07,427 --> 01:00:08,515
Why are we here?

663
01:00:09,516 --> 01:00:10,909
Someone tell me why we're here.

664
01:00:10,953 --> 01:00:13,695
- To make a car.
- To make the best car!

665
01:00:13,738 --> 01:00:16,001
To make the greatest car
the world has ever seen.

666
01:00:16,045 --> 01:00:18,656
As strong as Hercules,
as beautiful as Sofia Loren.

667
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:20,832
It must be ready for Geneva!

668
01:00:20,876 --> 01:00:23,792
It's not impossible
until we fail.

669
01:00:23,835 --> 01:00:27,099
If we fail, we fail
searching for greatness.

670
01:00:29,623 --> 01:00:31,582
Huh?

671
01:00:31,625 --> 01:00:34,106
We need to get Bevini
and Pedrazzi for fabrication
and assembly.

672
01:00:34,150 --> 01:00:36,108
They are brilliant and fast,
and everybody wants them.

673
01:00:36,152 --> 01:00:37,719
No, we'll get it.

674
01:00:37,762 --> 01:00:39,764
We'll have no time to make
our own differential or brakes.

675
01:00:39,808 --> 01:00:41,766
- We'll have to buy those.
- Germany for differentials.

676
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:44,682
- Zahnradfabrik.
England for brakes. Girling.

677
01:00:44,726 --> 01:00:46,640
Girling will never deliver
in time for Geneva.

678
01:00:46,684 --> 01:00:47,816
Leave it to me.

679
01:00:49,731 --> 01:00:51,210
Okay? Good?

680
01:00:52,429 --> 01:00:54,561
We chase the dream? Okay?

681
01:00:54,605 --> 01:00:57,390
- You're all crazy,
you know that.
- Yes! Isn't it wonderful!

682
01:00:57,434 --> 01:00:58,652
- Come on.

683
01:00:58,696 --> 01:01:00,045
- Cheers.
- Yes!

684
01:01:00,089 --> 01:01:03,919
No, no, no, no. Not two weeks!
One week.

685
01:01:03,962 --> 01:01:06,443
- I need the differential
in one week.
- <i>Grazie.</i>

686
01:01:12,449 --> 01:01:14,059
Nobody wants to do anything.

687
01:01:14,103 --> 01:01:17,671
Now I have to go Germany
and then England after that.

688
01:01:19,412 --> 01:01:22,285
I don't think it's wise
what you're doing, Ferruccio.

689
01:01:22,328 --> 01:01:24,504
You're going to suck
every penny out of the tractors,

690
01:01:24,548 --> 01:01:26,550
and if it doesn't work,
we will lose everything.

691
01:01:26,593 --> 01:01:28,639
Please. It will work.

692
01:01:28,682 --> 01:01:32,338
But what if it doesn't?
Look at what happened to Lancia.

693
01:01:32,382 --> 01:01:35,602
The unions will beat them,
and Lancia will go under.

694
01:01:35,646 --> 01:01:38,736
I take good care of my men,
they have no need to strike.

695
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:41,173
The price of petrol
keeps going up,

696
01:01:41,217 --> 01:01:44,350
and there's talk
of nationalizing
the energy industry.

697
01:01:44,394 --> 01:01:47,005
People will always
need to buy tractors.

698
01:01:47,049 --> 01:01:50,487
But luxury cars?
That is the first thing
they'll stop buying.

699
01:01:52,184 --> 01:01:55,231
Alright, well, then what about
the board of directors?

700
01:01:55,274 --> 01:01:58,364
You at least
have a responsibility
to tell them what you're doing.

701
01:01:59,452 --> 01:02:01,280
I talked to them.

702
01:02:01,324 --> 01:02:03,587
You went to the board?

703
01:02:03,630 --> 01:02:05,763
I knew you would object.

704
01:02:05,807 --> 01:02:08,026
No, you know that I am right.

705
01:02:08,070 --> 01:02:11,508
But you don't care about me,
you don't care about the board,

706
01:02:11,551 --> 01:02:14,554
you don't care about your men,
you don't even care
about your own son.

707
01:02:14,598 --> 01:02:17,122
The only thing that matters
is the great Lamborghini!

708
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:18,645
What do you want me to do?!

709
01:02:22,736 --> 01:02:24,347
You want me to be normal?

710
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:26,653
You want me to be
like everyone else?

711
01:02:26,697 --> 01:02:29,526
Living on my knees, afraid to
make the wrong decision?

712
01:02:29,569 --> 01:02:32,268
Making a fool of myself
at every turn?

713
01:02:32,311 --> 01:02:35,532
Crawling like a crab
on the floor of the ocean?

714
01:02:35,575 --> 01:02:38,013
I don't know who you
thought you married!

715
01:02:38,056 --> 01:02:41,538
I married someone
who could talk! Not only yell.

716
01:02:41,581 --> 01:02:44,019
For that I have bread,
and I have a lot.

717
01:02:49,111 --> 01:02:52,984
You have already gotten yourself
off of the ocean floor.

718
01:02:53,028 --> 01:02:55,291
What you're doing
could put you back there.

719
01:02:56,858 --> 01:02:59,861
You are the only one
who doesn't understand, Annita.

720
01:02:59,904 --> 01:03:02,689
Everyone loves me.
You are the only one.

721
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:05,040
Everyone else thinks I'm great.

722
01:03:05,083 --> 01:03:07,346
Who are all these people

723
01:03:07,390 --> 01:03:08,957
who think you're so great,
Ferruccio?

724
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:13,309
My workers. Huh?
My friends.

725
01:03:13,352 --> 01:03:15,398
They love you
because you pay them.

726
01:03:15,441 --> 01:03:18,053
Once they want
what you cannot pay

727
01:03:18,096 --> 01:03:21,186
they will strike
and you will be alone.

728
01:03:31,283 --> 01:03:32,589
What is this?

729
01:03:32,632 --> 01:03:36,462
CVs for your new secretary.

730
01:03:36,506 --> 01:03:38,595
I fired the blonde
you're fucking.

731
01:04:00,443 --> 01:04:02,140
Good. Coming left. Left.

732
01:04:02,184 --> 01:04:03,794
- It's left.
- Your left.

733
01:04:03,837 --> 01:04:04,708
My left.

734
01:04:04,751 --> 01:04:06,579
- Okay?
- Okay.

735
01:04:08,712 --> 01:04:11,497
I think
it's everything we talked about.

736
01:04:11,541 --> 01:04:12,977
It's a little extreme.

737
01:04:13,021 --> 01:04:14,457
I like it.

738
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:16,111
It's what you asked for.

739
01:04:17,677 --> 01:04:18,635
What is this?

740
01:04:18,678 --> 01:04:20,202
The headlights.

741
01:04:20,245 --> 01:04:22,291
They pop up
when you turn on car?

742
01:04:22,334 --> 01:04:23,596
- Yes.
- Pop up?

743
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:25,163
No, no, no, Franco.

744
01:04:25,207 --> 01:04:27,600
No, no, no. It's too complex.

745
01:04:27,644 --> 01:04:30,255
We need to make a statement,
not a question.

746
01:04:30,299 --> 01:04:33,215
The idea is
when you look at it,
there are no headlights,

747
01:04:33,258 --> 01:04:37,001
then when you turn the key,
the lids rise
and the lights come up.

748
01:04:37,045 --> 01:04:39,569
It's innovative.
Ferruccio, this is new.

749
01:04:39,612 --> 01:04:43,268
It's exciting. And you wanted it
to look like a race car.

750
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:45,792
Yes, a race car,
fast and powerful,

751
01:04:45,836 --> 01:04:47,490
but still a touring car,
gran turismo.

752
01:04:47,533 --> 01:04:51,233
And look here,
this-this bonnet is too big.

753
01:04:52,277 --> 01:04:56,064
Bonnet is perfect. Perfect.

754
01:04:56,107 --> 01:04:58,980
Franco, it looks like
a marshmallow
on top of a flounder.

755
01:05:03,897 --> 01:05:06,335
Franco. Franco.

756
01:05:27,660 --> 01:05:29,532
I'm sorry
I'm not good enough for you.

757
01:05:29,575 --> 01:05:32,535
Franco, I love you.

758
01:05:32,578 --> 01:05:34,493
I hate your design,
but I love you.

759
01:05:35,929 --> 01:05:38,106
All I'm asking is
that you start over.

760
01:05:39,629 --> 01:05:41,892
You ask us
to be creative, Ferruccio.

761
01:05:41,935 --> 01:05:45,591
And this is creative.
And you want me to start over.

762
01:05:48,029 --> 01:05:49,813
You can't ask me the world
and when I give it to you,

763
01:05:49,856 --> 01:05:51,815
you tell me
you want a different one.

764
01:05:51,858 --> 01:05:54,644
I've given you greatness,
Ferruccio. Greatness.

765
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:57,647
You've given me a look
at something I don't understand.

766
01:05:57,690 --> 01:06:01,172
Give me something I understand.
It's all I want.

767
01:06:02,782 --> 01:06:05,829
The world will be ready
for this one day, just not now.

768
01:06:08,788 --> 01:06:12,488
The bonnet is too big,
the grill too extreme.

769
01:06:12,531 --> 01:06:14,794
I like the headlights,
I love them!

770
01:06:14,838 --> 01:06:18,407
But not for the prototype.
Next year we do that.

771
01:06:18,450 --> 01:06:20,887
The back is too sharp,
it's too sharp.

772
01:06:20,931 --> 01:06:24,239
Less contour, more round.

773
01:06:24,282 --> 01:06:27,198
Franco. Franco, look at me.

774
01:06:28,156 --> 01:06:29,983
You are a great designer.

775
01:06:30,027 --> 01:06:31,289
Maybe the greatest.

776
01:06:32,682 --> 01:06:34,727
Give me something great.

777
01:06:39,297 --> 01:06:41,517
I don't have any more to give,
Ferruccio.

778
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:46,478
Ferruccio.

779
01:06:48,393 --> 01:06:49,612
Everything good?

780
01:06:50,961 --> 01:06:53,224
Nothing is good.

781
01:06:53,268 --> 01:06:55,835
The good news is the innovations
are going to work;

782
01:06:55,879 --> 01:06:58,577
the front and rear suspension's
on independent wheels,

783
01:06:58,621 --> 01:07:00,797
with double wishbones
and stabilizer bars.

784
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:02,581
We'll have the speed
and the power.

785
01:07:05,628 --> 01:07:07,456
Carburetors are too high.

786
01:07:07,499 --> 01:07:10,676
Exactly. We won't be able
to close the hood.

787
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,678
Obviously, the measurements
were off.

788
01:07:12,722 --> 01:07:15,028
I take responsibility for it,
Ferruccio.

789
01:07:15,072 --> 01:07:18,162
But we are working too fast,
there's no time
to check anything.

790
01:07:18,206 --> 01:07:21,470
I take responsibility, not you.

791
01:07:21,513 --> 01:07:24,168
So, what do we do?

792
01:07:24,212 --> 01:07:25,952
If you want to keep
the twin-choke carburetors,

793
01:07:25,996 --> 01:07:27,737
we need to create a new design.

794
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:30,218
There's no room to lower them
or make them smaller.

795
01:07:30,261 --> 01:07:32,394
What if we make them horizontal?

796
01:07:32,437 --> 01:07:34,613
I thought of that.
There's no room.

797
01:07:34,657 --> 01:07:36,267
Then we make room.

798
01:07:38,139 --> 01:07:42,360
It's possible, but these things
take time, Ferruccio.

799
01:07:42,404 --> 01:07:45,842
I can talk to Franco,
maybe he can raise the hood,
that's an easier fix.

800
01:07:45,885 --> 01:07:50,238
What are we going to make
a hump like a camel?
No, don't think so.

801
01:07:50,281 --> 01:07:53,458
We can't redesign,
we'd have to make a new engine,
we'd never make Geneva.

802
01:07:53,502 --> 01:07:57,636
Excuse me, Ferruccio,
but wouldn't it be better
to miss it

803
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:00,639
than present a car
that doesn't deliver on
everything we want it to be?

804
01:08:06,123 --> 01:08:11,215
Make the carburetors horizontal.
You'll find a way.

805
01:08:30,191 --> 01:08:32,062
I got a proposition
for you, mate.

806
01:08:34,804 --> 01:08:37,633
I'd like to be your test driver
for this new car of ours.

807
01:08:37,676 --> 01:08:40,462
- I need a great one.
- You're looking at him.

808
01:08:42,855 --> 01:08:44,640
Are all Australians like you?

809
01:08:44,683 --> 01:08:48,644
No, Australians would love
to be like me, a kiwi.

810
01:08:54,519 --> 01:08:57,827
Actually, all kiwis
would love to be like me, too.

811
01:08:57,870 --> 01:09:00,917
But, nah. I'm a one-off.

812
01:09:06,227 --> 01:09:08,098
Ah, she's a beaut, mate.

813
01:09:11,754 --> 01:09:13,321
This is what you gave me.

814
01:09:17,368 --> 01:09:19,152
I think we're pretty close.

815
01:09:33,297 --> 01:09:36,039
I thought the gold
might be wrong at first, but...

816
01:09:36,082 --> 01:09:38,389
I'm eternally grateful, maestro.

817
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:46,876
It's going to be
the greatest car
that's ever been made.

818
01:09:46,919 --> 01:09:50,793
The Lamborghini 350 GT.
We unveil in Geneva.

819
01:09:52,273 --> 01:09:57,060
Oh, interview?
That's fantastic, tomorrow.

820
01:09:57,103 --> 01:10:00,193
Tomorrow is Christmas Eve.

821
01:10:00,237 --> 01:10:02,239
No, no, no, no.
Tomorrow works.

822
01:10:02,283 --> 01:10:07,113
That's great.
Fantastic. Ciao.

823
01:10:11,117 --> 01:10:12,989
Car enthusiasts all over America

824
01:10:13,032 --> 01:10:15,034
are hearing rumors
that after dominating

825
01:10:15,078 --> 01:10:17,210
in the field of tractors,
air conditioning and heating,

826
01:10:17,254 --> 01:10:20,649
Lamborghini is gonna be
the big news of the upcoming
automotive season.

827
01:10:20,692 --> 01:10:22,607
This March,
at the Geneva Motor Show,

828
01:10:22,651 --> 01:10:26,002
I will unveil the first
Lamborghini Gran Turismo
automobile.

829
01:10:26,045 --> 01:10:27,960
Ah, very exciting, of course.

830
01:10:28,004 --> 01:10:29,527
But, tell me why you think
that the world

831
01:10:29,571 --> 01:10:30,746
needs another luxury car.

832
01:10:30,789 --> 01:10:33,183
We have the Ferraris,
we have the Maseratis,

833
01:10:33,226 --> 01:10:35,577
that's nothing to say
of our friends
in England and Germany.

834
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:40,364
Yes, yes, good cars all.
Many of which I own and drive.

835
01:10:40,408 --> 01:10:42,366
But it's perfection
that I am after.

836
01:10:42,410 --> 01:10:46,283
And as great as these cars are,
I'm not convinced
they are special.

837
01:10:46,327 --> 01:10:49,634
Special is drinking
your favorite wine
for the first time.

838
01:10:49,678 --> 01:10:54,030
Special is...
losing your virginity.

839
01:10:54,073 --> 01:10:57,207
Special is that one thing
you never forget.

840
01:10:57,250 --> 01:11:00,602
This is what we bring to Geneva.

841
01:11:00,645 --> 01:11:04,432
Here, here and here.

842
01:11:10,873 --> 01:11:12,135
Great?

843
01:11:14,224 --> 01:11:15,573
Great.

844
01:11:17,923 --> 01:11:19,272
Beautiful.

845
01:11:19,316 --> 01:11:20,926
Well done.

846
01:11:20,970 --> 01:11:22,450
Bravo, bravo.

847
01:11:45,603 --> 01:11:47,170
We reconfigured
the exhaust pipes

848
01:11:47,213 --> 01:11:48,693
and moved them
closer to the front.

849
01:11:48,737 --> 01:11:51,348
We widened the axles
an inch on each side.

850
01:11:51,392 --> 01:11:54,482
The wheels will be
15 inches instead of 16.

851
01:11:54,525 --> 01:11:56,484
We also moved from
a standard shifter

852
01:11:56,527 --> 01:11:59,138
to a gated shifter
which gave us more room.

853
01:11:59,182 --> 01:12:02,838
- Enough?
- Theoretically.

854
01:12:02,881 --> 01:12:05,144
Okay. Let's see if it fits.

855
01:12:25,121 --> 01:12:26,383
We have a car.

856
01:12:31,127 --> 01:12:35,740
When we are a success in Geneva,
they will want to know
our next idea.

857
01:12:35,784 --> 01:12:37,481
You start thinking
about this now.

858
01:12:37,525 --> 01:12:39,048
Excuse me?

859
01:12:39,091 --> 01:12:41,877
I only have a name, the Miura.

860
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:44,009
Like the bull.

861
01:12:44,053 --> 01:12:45,837
It must be
the most beautiful car

862
01:12:45,881 --> 01:12:47,448
the world has ever seen.

863
01:12:49,972 --> 01:12:50,886
Yeah?

864
01:12:52,844 --> 01:12:55,499
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

865
01:12:55,543 --> 01:13:01,766
<i>our special guest of honor,</i>
<i>the one and only Tony Renis.</i>

866
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:15,927
This one is for my great friend,
Ferruccio Lamborghini.

867
01:14:15,971 --> 01:14:17,668
The pride of Italy.

868
01:14:20,018 --> 01:14:21,629
Maestro.

869
01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:52,964
You're Lamborghini?

870
01:14:54,879 --> 01:14:56,185
Ferruccio.

871
01:14:57,229 --> 01:14:58,666
What are you drawing?

872
01:14:58,709 --> 01:15:00,581
An idea.

873
01:15:00,624 --> 01:15:02,060
For a car?

874
01:15:02,104 --> 01:15:04,759
For the greatest car
in the world.

875
01:15:04,802 --> 01:15:06,456
Can I see it?

876
01:15:11,069 --> 01:15:11,896
Come.

877
01:15:20,078 --> 01:15:22,037
What do you see?

878
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:25,301
Lines on a napkin.
What do you see?

879
01:15:25,344 --> 01:15:28,043
- A dream.
- What?

880
01:15:28,086 --> 01:15:31,002
- Close your eyes.
- Why?

881
01:15:31,046 --> 01:15:32,525
Close them.

882
01:15:37,226 --> 01:15:38,183
Open them.

883
01:15:49,238 --> 01:15:51,719
Now, the headlights on my Miura

884
01:15:51,762 --> 01:15:55,157
will have beautiful eyelashes,
like yours.

885
01:16:07,038 --> 01:16:10,955
Tonino,
go wait in the car. Please.

886
01:16:16,526 --> 01:16:19,834
Ah, Annita,
I've been waiting for you.

887
01:16:19,877 --> 01:16:21,662
Let me introduce Gabriella.

888
01:16:21,705 --> 01:16:24,012
Please don't. Leave.

889
01:16:24,055 --> 01:16:26,928
- Annita, please.
- Leave, now!

890
01:16:26,971 --> 01:16:31,933
Annita, I'm showing her
my sketch.

891
01:16:31,976 --> 01:16:36,111
You said once
that you would never love me,

892
01:16:36,154 --> 01:16:39,244
and that I would hate you
for it in the end.

893
01:16:39,288 --> 01:16:41,072
But you were wrong.

894
01:16:41,116 --> 01:16:44,554
I don't hate you,
I feel sorry for you.

895
01:16:44,597 --> 01:16:47,688
You have a hole in your heart,
and I was wrong to think

896
01:16:47,731 --> 01:16:50,995
that I could fill it
with all the love in mine.

897
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:54,477
But now I know,
you never want
to have it filled.

898
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:57,001
And now, neither do I.

899
01:16:59,351 --> 01:17:00,962
And what about Tonino?

900
01:17:01,005 --> 01:17:03,573
- What about him?
- He is my son.

901
01:17:03,616 --> 01:17:07,708
Are you asking me
to leave him with you?

902
01:17:07,751 --> 01:17:10,885
And leave him without
the only mother he's ever known?

903
01:17:10,928 --> 01:17:15,193
If that is what you're asking,
then ask.

904
01:17:15,237 --> 01:17:16,891
If you have it in you,
then ask.

905
01:17:23,419 --> 01:17:24,986
Goodbye, Ferruccio.

906
01:17:45,963 --> 01:17:47,182
Where are they?

907
01:17:48,444 --> 01:17:50,185
Maybe they had an accident.

908
01:17:50,228 --> 01:17:52,100
Maybe you
should have an accident.

909
01:17:56,844 --> 01:17:58,933
There are so many things
we don't know.

910
01:17:58,976 --> 01:18:00,586
And this is a prototype
not a car.

911
01:18:05,635 --> 01:18:07,419
I told him not to push it.

912
01:18:08,464 --> 01:18:10,161
We don't know anything.

913
01:18:10,205 --> 01:18:12,033
Baby steps!

914
01:18:12,076 --> 01:18:14,470
We told him, baby steps!

915
01:18:42,193 --> 01:18:43,804
It's everything we want!

916
01:18:57,948 --> 01:18:59,341
It should be green.

917
01:18:59,907 --> 01:19:01,822
What?

918
01:19:01,865 --> 01:19:03,954
- Green, should be green.
- Green?

919
01:19:03,998 --> 01:19:06,783
But-but this or next one?

920
01:19:06,827 --> 01:19:08,785
This, for Geneva, green.

921
01:19:08,829 --> 01:19:10,134
- Hm?
- Okay.

922
01:19:27,195 --> 01:19:29,588
Italy has long been
an agricultural society,

923
01:19:29,632 --> 01:19:33,070
but post-war Italy
has given birth
to an industrial Renaissance.

924
01:19:33,114 --> 01:19:35,333
Ever wonder how one might create
something new in a world

925
01:19:35,377 --> 01:19:39,598
of inventive, challenging,
and innovative car manufacturers
and designers?

926
01:19:39,642 --> 01:19:41,078
Well, I'm standing here
with somebody

927
01:19:41,122 --> 01:19:42,993
who just might be able
to have those answers.

928
01:19:43,037 --> 01:19:45,169
None other than
Ferruccio Lamborghini.

929
01:19:45,213 --> 01:19:46,736
Ciao.

930
01:19:46,779 --> 01:19:47,824
So, how does
somebody like you demonstrate

931
01:19:47,868 --> 01:19:49,217
a clear break from tradition

932
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:50,914
and deliver something brand new?

933
01:19:50,958 --> 01:19:53,917
The Lamborghini GT is both
beautiful and high performing.

934
01:19:53,961 --> 01:19:57,921
It's a touring car that is fast
and powerful as any racing car.

935
01:19:57,965 --> 01:20:00,576
And, can this
new car of yours be all of that?

936
01:20:00,619 --> 01:20:02,317
Oh, it can be
all of that and more.

937
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:05,407
It is a thing of beauty.

938
01:20:05,450 --> 01:20:08,105
But a thing of beauty
can only be a thing of beauty
if it's shared.

939
01:20:08,149 --> 01:20:14,329
Ladies and gentlemen,
members of the world press,
I give you Lamborghini GT!

940
01:20:21,858 --> 01:20:24,556
My friends, my friends,
I can see in your eyes

941
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:26,819
how you love my car
but don't be shy.

942
01:20:26,863 --> 01:20:30,954
To drive a Lamborghini,
to own a Lamborghini,
you must not be shy.

943
01:20:30,998 --> 01:20:33,174
Mr. Lamborghini,
I know there are many questions

944
01:20:33,217 --> 01:20:34,566
about what's under the hood
of this car,

945
01:20:36,220 --> 01:20:38,701
- what is the price tag
of the Lamborghini GT?

946
01:20:38,744 --> 01:20:41,095
- What is the price
of a beautiful woman?
- Hm.

947
01:20:41,138 --> 01:20:44,402
A great bottle of wine?
A pasta you remember
the rest of your life?

948
01:20:44,446 --> 01:20:47,014
These things are worth
whatever they ask you
to pay for them.

949
01:20:47,057 --> 01:20:50,408
You buy a Ferrari
when you want to be someone.

950
01:20:50,452 --> 01:20:53,020
You buy a Lamborghini
when you are someone.

951
01:20:54,108 --> 01:20:55,979
Lamborghini.

952
01:20:57,633 --> 01:20:59,635
Bravo, bravo.

953
01:21:34,452 --> 01:21:37,238
<i>Strike, strike,</i>
<i>strike Lamborghini.</i>

954
01:21:37,281 --> 01:21:40,763
<i>Strike, strike,</i>
<i>strike Lamborghini.</i>

955
01:21:40,806 --> 01:21:42,417
<i>After a decades-long high,</i>

956
01:21:42,460 --> 01:21:43,896
<i>everything has come</i>
<i>crashing down</i>

957
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:45,594
<i>in a crushing blow</i>
<i>to the post-war</i>

958
01:21:45,637 --> 01:21:46,987
<i>automobile industry.</i>

959
01:21:47,030 --> 01:21:49,163
<i>Severe government restrictions </i>
<i>dealt the latest blow</i>

960
01:21:49,206 --> 01:21:51,730
<i>to an industry </i>
<i>that was already on its knees.</i>

961
01:21:51,774 --> 01:21:53,341
<i>The combination</i>
<i>of union strikes,</i>

962
01:21:53,384 --> 01:21:55,473
<i>and a 300 percent increase</i>
<i>in the price of oil,</i>

963
01:21:55,517 --> 01:21:57,867
<i>has proven</i>
<i>more damaging to Italy</i>

964
01:21:57,910 --> 01:22:00,826
<i>than other European</i>
<i>industrial nations.</i>

965
01:22:00,870 --> 01:22:02,654
<i>Even Ferruccio Lamborghini,</i>

966
01:22:02,698 --> 01:22:04,700
<i>who's famous for having</i>
<i>personally negotiated</i>

967
01:22:04,743 --> 01:22:07,485
<i>his employee contracts,</i>
<i>has met his match</i>

968
01:22:07,529 --> 01:22:10,140
<i>in the power of the automotive </i>
<i>industrial unions.</i>

969
01:22:10,184 --> 01:22:13,883
<i>There was a time when Ferruccio </i>
<i>was a working man himself,</i>

970
01:22:13,926 --> 01:22:15,885
<i>where are you now, Ferruccio?</i>

971
01:22:15,928 --> 01:22:18,061
<i>Ferruccio, where are you?</i>
<i>Speak up.</i>

972
01:22:18,105 --> 01:22:19,541
<i>Are you with</i>
<i>the working men and women</i>

973
01:22:19,584 --> 01:22:20,629
<i>of this world or aren't you?</i>

974
01:22:20,672 --> 01:22:22,718
<i>Where are you, Ferruccio?</i>

975
01:22:22,761 --> 01:22:24,111
<i>Where are you now, Ferruccio?</i>

976
01:22:24,154 --> 01:22:27,201
<i>Where? Huh? Where?</i>
<i>Where are you now?</i>

977
01:22:45,828 --> 01:22:49,005
Half the money from the sale
of the company will go to you.

978
01:22:49,049 --> 01:22:50,746
The rest to my brothers.

979
01:22:57,274 --> 01:22:59,189
I put a clause in the contract.

980
01:22:59,233 --> 01:23:01,800
They must keep the name
Lamborghini forever.

981
01:23:16,641 --> 01:23:18,078
How is the family?

982
01:23:19,818 --> 01:23:20,950
Good.

983
01:23:20,993 --> 01:23:22,212
How old?

984
01:23:23,387 --> 01:23:26,782
Girls are three and five.

985
01:23:26,825 --> 01:23:28,436
Ferruccio is two.

986
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:31,395
His birthday was last Saturday.

987
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:33,658
Two years old already.

988
01:23:34,703 --> 01:23:36,313
I should have been there.

989
01:23:36,357 --> 01:23:39,229
Oh, it's okay.
The gift was lovely.

990
01:23:39,273 --> 01:23:42,928
He loves boats.
Plays with it in the tub.

991
01:23:42,972 --> 01:23:44,278
Won't take a bath without it.

992
01:23:44,321 --> 01:23:47,019
We call him Captain Ferruccio.

993
01:23:54,723 --> 01:23:57,334
Have you heard?

994
01:23:57,378 --> 01:24:00,294
They've appointed me
Cavaliere del Lavoro.

995
01:24:00,337 --> 01:24:03,253
That's exciting.

996
01:24:03,297 --> 01:24:06,474
Now when I talk to the president
I can use the informal "tu".

997
01:24:10,695 --> 01:24:12,175
You've done it all.

998
01:24:12,219 --> 01:24:14,656
Everything that
you ever wanted.

999
01:24:18,181 --> 01:24:20,488
Was it worth it, Papa?

1000
01:24:25,710 --> 01:24:27,016
Tonino...

1001
01:24:28,235 --> 01:24:31,760
It's okay.
I should get home now.

1002
01:24:46,862 --> 01:24:48,211
Ciao, Papa.
