1
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,150
Attack!

2
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,067
Attack!

3
00:03:07,025 --> 00:03:10,734
Go! Come on! Faster!

4
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,984
Heinrich, come on! Forwards! Come now!

5
00:03:16,067 --> 00:03:17,775
To the ladders!

6
00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:19,275
On my command!

7
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:20,567
Forwards!

8
00:03:22,692 --> 00:03:25,234
Heinrich! Get out there!

9
00:03:25,317 --> 00:03:27,442
All of you, go!

10
00:03:28,317 --> 00:03:30,525
Come on! Get out of there!

11
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:33,650
Go, Heinrich! Get out there now!

12
00:03:34,275 --> 00:03:35,525
Attack!

13
00:03:36,109 --> 00:03:37,067
Attack!

14
00:03:40,984 --> 00:03:43,067
Go! Forwards!

15
00:04:08,317 --> 00:04:09,442
Heinrich!

16
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,817
Heinrich!

17
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,984
-Attack! Attack!
-Attack!

18
00:05:04,317 --> 00:05:09,150
ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT

19
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:41,900
Come on!

20
00:08:10,484 --> 00:08:14,650
NORTHERN GERMANY
SPRING 1917

21
00:08:16,317 --> 00:08:19,484
THIRD YEAR OF WAR

22
00:08:36,859 --> 00:08:39,900
Paul! Paul!

23
00:08:42,859 --> 00:08:45,317
-Paul! Well?
-So?

24
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:46,859
Mhm.

25
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,359
-Well then?
-I don't know.

26
00:08:50,442 --> 00:08:52,359
-Does he know we're all going?
-Yes, of course.

27
00:08:52,442 --> 00:08:53,442
Staying at home?

28
00:08:53,525 --> 00:08:55,900
My God, you're tied
to your mother's apron strings, my friend.

29
00:08:57,692 --> 00:08:59,275
Give me it, I'll scribble something.

30
00:08:59,359 --> 00:09:02,275
-It has to be signed by his parents.
-Well, someone. Come on, pass it here.

31
00:09:02,359 --> 00:09:04,567
-That won't work, they'll find out.
-How will they?

32
00:09:05,234 --> 00:09:06,067
Well?

33
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,859
Is his mother a pen pal of theirs?

34
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:13,525
-Give me your pen.
-Ah, I'm sorry.

35
00:09:13,609 --> 00:09:14,442
Oh!

36
00:09:14,525 --> 00:09:15,359
Ludwig.

37
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:18,109
You mustn't. Your father will hit you.

38
00:09:18,192 --> 00:09:21,109
Have you got a better idea?
I'm not being left behind here.

39
00:09:35,192 --> 00:09:36,567
<i>Jawohl!</i>

40
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:39,817
Congratulations, Private Baumer.
We're going to the front.

41
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,067
A dead man walking.

42
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:46,442
You stand here
on the threshold of existence.

43
00:09:47,692 --> 00:09:49,359
Remember this moment.

44
00:09:51,275 --> 00:09:52,775
It is a great moment.

45
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:57,984
For in years to come, you will be judged
based on what you dared to become today.

46
00:09:58,609 --> 00:10:00,859
The iron youth of Germany.

47
00:10:01,775 --> 00:10:02,859
My friends,

48
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,150
we are fortunate
to be alive at a great time.

49
00:10:06,234 --> 00:10:08,692
Your deeds will be the water

50
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,775
nourishing the growth
of a strong and noble route.

51
00:10:11,859 --> 00:10:13,984
Stand still and listen up, Leinemann!

52
00:10:14,775 --> 00:10:16,942
The Kaiser needs soldiers, not children.

53
00:10:18,984 --> 00:10:23,442
I am certain that I will see
most of you again soon, here at home.

54
00:10:24,442 --> 00:10:27,734
Your sword returned to its scabbard
with honour and respect.

55
00:10:28,859 --> 00:10:32,525
A cross crafted from iron
proudly displayed upon your chest.

56
00:10:33,192 --> 00:10:34,775
However, take heed of this.

57
00:10:35,984 --> 00:10:39,442
In the darkest of hours,
let me assure you it will happen,

58
00:10:39,984 --> 00:10:43,192
that prior to an attack,
you will harbour doubts.

59
00:10:43,692 --> 00:10:46,650
But this is not the time
to concede to any mental weakness.

60
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:51,859
Any unsteadiness, any hesitation
is a betrayal of the fatherland!

61
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:54,817
For modern war is like a game of chess.

62
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,400
It is never about an individual soldier.

63
00:10:57,484 --> 00:10:59,817
Our only care
is for the entirety of the body.

64
00:11:01,484 --> 00:11:04,525
You have the chance to earn the right
to wear the uniforms you have been given.

65
00:11:05,275 --> 00:11:08,609
And by going to the front line
in Flanders, we'll pierce the enemy.

66
00:11:08,692 --> 00:11:12,400
And then you will, in a few short weeks,

67
00:11:12,484 --> 00:11:15,109
finally march on Paris!

68
00:11:15,192 --> 00:11:16,650
Yeah!

69
00:11:16,734 --> 00:11:18,025
Our future,

70
00:11:18,692 --> 00:11:20,317
the future of <i>Deutschland</i>,

71
00:11:21,442 --> 00:11:24,109
lies in the hands
of its greatest generation.

72
00:11:25,359 --> 00:11:27,817
My friends, that is you, you see!

73
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,859
Yeah!

74
00:11:28,942 --> 00:11:30,900
Therefore, off to the camps

75
00:11:30,984 --> 00:11:34,650
for the Kaiser, God, and the fatherland!

76
00:11:34,734 --> 00:11:36,234
Yeah!

77
00:11:47,317 --> 00:11:48,150
Next.

78
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,234
Next.

79
00:11:53,817 --> 00:11:54,775
Next.

80
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,192
-Next.
-Next.

81
00:11:57,275 --> 00:11:59,025
Baumer, Paul.
53 Wiesengrund.

82
00:11:59,525 --> 00:12:02,692
Born November 18th, 1899. Correct?

83
00:12:02,775 --> 00:12:03,650
<i>Jawohl</i>, sir.

84
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:09,359
Next.

85
00:12:11,109 --> 00:12:11,942
Paul.

86
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:16,275
Here. Your father can be proud of you.

87
00:12:16,359 --> 00:12:17,192
Yes.

88
00:12:19,984 --> 00:12:21,109
Is everything alright?

89
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:23,692
Yes. I'm eager to get on with it.

90
00:12:24,609 --> 00:12:25,442
Move along.

91
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:27,567
Here he comes.

92
00:12:28,234 --> 00:12:30,359
-Emil Hermann.
-Name and address.

93
00:12:30,442 --> 00:12:31,817
-And the next.
-Excuse me.

94
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,525
It already belongs to someone.

95
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:39,067
Ah, yes. It was probably too small
for the fellow. Happens all the time.

96
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,775
Here. It's yours.

97
00:12:41,442 --> 00:12:42,567
Thank you.

98
00:12:59,275 --> 00:13:01,400
I remember it, you were.

99
00:13:03,025 --> 00:13:05,817
Oh, Ludwig, will you be snatching away
all the ladies from us now?

100
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,984
Yeah.

101
00:13:07,067 --> 00:13:08,984
My concern is that you don't shoot us.

102
00:13:19,942 --> 00:13:21,359
She won't wait, Franz.

103
00:13:22,942 --> 00:13:23,859
She won't do it.

104
00:13:25,775 --> 00:13:27,275
You lady killer, you.

105
00:14:12,567 --> 00:14:16,484
LA MALMAISON, NORTHERN FRANCE
25 KM TO THE WESTERN FRONT

106
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,317
-Your name?
-Kropp. Albert Kropp, sir.

107
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,400
Do you like dirty girls,
Kropp?

108
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,567
Do you like dirty girls?

109
00:14:40,025 --> 00:14:42,025
Uh, no. I don't, sir.

110
00:14:42,109 --> 00:14:44,109
So why
do you sleep with one then?

111
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,942
Report for guard duty at three o'clock.

112
00:14:47,859 --> 00:14:50,817
Gentlemen, you'll be fighting
in a godforsaken shithole.

113
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:54,817
And you'll kindly do so with a clean G98.

114
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,442
You will pamper it.

115
00:14:56,525 --> 00:14:57,984
You will love it.

116
00:14:58,067 --> 00:15:00,192
And damn it,
you will keep it as immaculate

117
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:02,150
as the thighs of the Holy Virgin.

118
00:15:02,817 --> 00:15:04,150
Do we understand each other?

119
00:15:04,234 --> 00:15:05,900
-<i>Jawohl</i>, sir!
-<i>Jawohl</i>, sir!

120
00:15:05,984 --> 00:15:08,859
Welcome
to the 78th Reserve Infantry Regiment.

121
00:15:10,525 --> 00:15:12,067
We are now on the Western Front.

122
00:15:13,317 --> 00:15:15,650
-Welcome to Paris!
-Yeah! Welcome to Paris!

123
00:15:22,192 --> 00:15:23,025
Ah!

124
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:26,942
Down there! Down there!

125
00:15:30,734 --> 00:15:32,609
Down there! This way!

126
00:15:36,609 --> 00:15:37,817
This way!

127
00:15:44,775 --> 00:15:47,817
-Go on! Over there on the right!
-Damn it, what happened?

128
00:15:48,692 --> 00:15:51,275
I have orders to hand over the company
to the front by 6:00 p.m.

129
00:15:51,359 --> 00:15:52,859
That you may, but on foot.

130
00:15:53,359 --> 00:15:54,900
You must give us the trucks, lieutenant.

131
00:15:54,984 --> 00:15:56,442
With all due respect, I have orders--

132
00:15:56,525 --> 00:15:58,484
Take the orders
and stick them up your arse.

133
00:15:58,567 --> 00:16:00,567
I have 40 men here
who are dying in the mud.

134
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:01,859
Get out right now, will you?

135
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:05,984
Everyone, get up.

136
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,275
Come on, get on with it.

137
00:16:10,359 --> 00:16:12,109
You heard the staff surgeon.

138
00:16:14,234 --> 00:16:17,150
Faster, soldiers. Don't fall asleep here.

139
00:16:20,567 --> 00:16:21,692
Keep moving.

140
00:16:27,984 --> 00:16:29,525
-Franz Muller, correct?
-Yes.

141
00:16:30,067 --> 00:16:31,109
The supreme army command

142
00:16:31,192 --> 00:16:33,900
expects you to survive
at least six weeks of being here.

143
00:16:33,984 --> 00:16:35,984
Would you like that,
in six weeks, to still be alive?

144
00:16:36,067 --> 00:16:37,359
-<i>Jawohl</i>, sir.
-Then walk quicker

145
00:16:37,442 --> 00:16:39,525
and stop dragging your feet
like you would do at home.

146
00:16:40,442 --> 00:16:41,942
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

147
00:16:42,984 --> 00:16:44,109
Hurry up.

148
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,692
We're not at a tea party here.

149
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,109
Gas!

150
00:16:55,609 --> 00:16:57,942
-Gas!
-Gas!

151
00:16:58,025 --> 00:16:59,650
Gas!

152
00:16:59,734 --> 00:17:00,942
Gas!

153
00:17:02,234 --> 00:17:03,817
Gas masks on!

154
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,442
That, gentlemen, was a fat pig.

155
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,859
If the French could aim better,

156
00:17:08,942 --> 00:17:13,275
you could scrape us all off the road
with a spoon and bury us in a saucepan.

157
00:17:13,817 --> 00:17:17,234
But one thing
that's as certain as amen in church.

158
00:17:18,234 --> 00:17:21,067
Fat pigs don't carry gas.

159
00:17:21,942 --> 00:17:24,109
Eyes straight ahead.

160
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:40,650
-Are you deaf?
-No, sir.

161
00:17:41,275 --> 00:17:43,442
I was just trying to put my mask on.

162
00:17:51,025 --> 00:17:54,484
Paul Baumer,
you will almost certainly be dead by dawn.

163
00:17:55,484 --> 00:17:57,025
You should eat something, man.

164
00:17:58,817 --> 00:18:01,359
Attention! Gas masks off!

165
00:18:01,442 --> 00:18:03,317
Gas masks off!

166
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,484
Not you.

167
00:18:04,567 --> 00:18:07,025
You keep yours on
until guard duty tonight.

168
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:09,692
Both you and that useless pig.

169
00:18:10,484 --> 00:18:12,567
Fall in line. March.

170
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:13,859
Fall in line!

171
00:18:13,942 --> 00:18:16,359
Stay together and keep moving!

172
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:19,150
Come on, hurry up!

173
00:18:19,234 --> 00:18:20,067
Go!

174
00:18:37,025 --> 00:18:40,150
Come on. Paul, come on.
Give me your knapsack.

175
00:18:40,234 --> 00:18:41,984
Next time, you carry mine.

176
00:18:54,484 --> 00:18:56,234
Congratulations, soldiers.

177
00:18:56,317 --> 00:18:58,150
This is your home now.

178
00:18:58,234 --> 00:18:59,234
Helmets off.

179
00:19:00,609 --> 00:19:03,525
I see the men have been enjoying
themselves in my absence, Steinberger.

180
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,400
We were under barrage all night.

181
00:19:05,484 --> 00:19:06,567
The men are a mess.

182
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,650
I think dry boots
would be a good place to begin.

183
00:19:09,192 --> 00:19:10,775
Oh, you'd rather we all drown then?

184
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:13,817
Everyone pitch in!
Come on, bail out the trench.

185
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,359
Get in line
to bail the water!

186
00:19:19,442 --> 00:19:21,192
What are you waiting for, Baumer?

187
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:26,067
Why are you still loitering here?
Go and help bail out the trenches.

188
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,650
Throw a dog a piece of meat.

189
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:29,275
Come on, all of you!

190
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:30,942
It will always snap it up.

191
00:19:32,484 --> 00:19:33,859
Give a man power…

192
00:19:37,942 --> 00:19:39,317
Man is a beast.

193
00:19:40,567 --> 00:19:41,442
Drink.

194
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:48,359
Katczinsky, come over here.
Give us a hand.

195
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,109
Tonight, it'll be even worse.

196
00:20:25,109 --> 00:20:26,025
Sorry.

197
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:27,859
Forget it.

198
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,442
Somehow, this isn't how I imagined it.

199
00:20:31,525 --> 00:20:32,525
Just shut up, Ludwig.

200
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:36,359
My hands. I can't feel my hands any more.

201
00:20:44,275 --> 00:20:45,734
Stick them down your underwear.

202
00:20:46,275 --> 00:20:47,442
It always works for me.

203
00:21:27,609 --> 00:21:29,525
That will make it shoot better,
will it?

204
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,734
-Did you hear that?
-Hear what?

205
00:21:47,234 --> 00:21:48,692
That sound. Listen.

206
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:50,025
There's nothing there.

207
00:22:00,484 --> 00:22:02,275
Our first French to shoot.

208
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:04,275
Calm down, Paulchen.

209
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:10,650
There's someone out there.

210
00:22:21,775 --> 00:22:22,775
Who's there?

211
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:25,234
Hey.

212
00:22:27,859 --> 00:22:28,859
Show yourself!

213
00:22:47,192 --> 00:22:48,400
Oh, no, no, no!

214
00:22:48,484 --> 00:22:51,317
I'm hit! I'm hit! I've been hit! Get off!

215
00:22:52,192 --> 00:22:54,359
-No, Paul. No.
-What's going on?

216
00:22:54,442 --> 00:22:55,525
You're fine.

217
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,734
What is it?

218
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,317
The others, over there. They shot at me.

219
00:23:12,317 --> 00:23:13,859
They saw the flash of your muzzle.

220
00:23:15,234 --> 00:23:16,192
Huh?

221
00:23:16,275 --> 00:23:17,775
From now on, keep your heads down.

222
00:23:17,859 --> 00:23:20,109
If you don't want to catch
the next bullet with your teeth,

223
00:23:20,192 --> 00:23:21,275
move ten meters to the left.

224
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:24,109
Shoot, change cover.
Shoot, change cover. Understand?

225
00:23:25,859 --> 00:23:26,692
Yeah.

226
00:23:41,775 --> 00:23:43,275
Come on. Paul.

227
00:24:33,275 --> 00:24:36,067
Take cover! Take cover! Alarm!

228
00:24:39,025 --> 00:24:40,067
Here!

229
00:24:40,775 --> 00:24:43,317
Baumer, come here. Quickly, come on.

230
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:44,900
Into the bunker!

231
00:24:48,609 --> 00:24:50,859
Inside! Inside! Inside!

232
00:25:09,192 --> 00:25:10,442
"Be careful what you eat."

233
00:25:11,317 --> 00:25:13,984
That's what my mother said.

234
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,109
-We'll always be together, won't we?
-Yeah.

235
00:25:18,192 --> 00:25:19,775
We'll stick together. We'll always be.

236
00:25:21,692 --> 00:25:25,150
I can't do this, Paul.
I can't do this. I need to go home.

237
00:25:25,234 --> 00:25:26,442
I need to go home.

238
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,192
Creeping barrage.

239
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:53,192
What?

240
00:25:54,442 --> 00:25:55,400
Every couple of minutes,

241
00:25:55,484 --> 00:25:57,400
the artillery barrage
makes an advance forward.

242
00:25:58,609 --> 00:25:59,900
And directly after that,

243
00:26:00,942 --> 00:26:02,567
the infantry moves forward.

244
00:26:04,234 --> 00:26:05,442
What are you saying, exactly?

245
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,234
That's how they come.

246
00:26:28,275 --> 00:26:29,275
Where are you going?

247
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:30,317
I'll come back.

248
00:26:31,067 --> 00:26:32,109
It's nearly over.

249
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:36,025
-No! Let me go.
-Stay where you are.

250
00:26:36,109 --> 00:26:38,609
-Let me out of here. I want to get out.
-Calm down.

251
00:26:39,984 --> 00:26:41,067
Calm yourself.

252
00:26:45,567 --> 00:26:46,442
No!

253
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:53,192
Get out! Out! Out! Out!

254
00:26:53,984 --> 00:26:54,859
Out!

255
00:27:55,817 --> 00:27:57,775
Hey, that's Paul!

256
00:27:57,859 --> 00:27:58,734
Albert!

257
00:27:58,817 --> 00:28:00,650
Come here, we found Paul!

258
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,317
Paul!

259
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:13,692
Are you alright?

260
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,317
Is everything alright, Paul?

261
00:28:16,942 --> 00:28:18,567
Come on. Paul, come on.

262
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:19,817
I'll help you.

263
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,442
Come on. Get up, will you? Sit down.

264
00:28:22,525 --> 00:28:23,609
Are you injured?

265
00:28:23,692 --> 00:28:25,525
Paul, are you injured?

266
00:28:25,609 --> 00:28:27,567
-Can you hear me?
-We need help over here!

267
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:29,525
-See you later, Paul.
-We'll see you later, Paul.

268
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:43,234
Go on! Go on!

269
00:28:47,067 --> 00:28:48,192
Here's another one.

270
00:28:49,025 --> 00:28:50,109
We need help!

271
00:28:53,692 --> 00:28:54,525
Steady.

272
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:56,359
Steady.

273
00:29:01,692 --> 00:29:02,525
That's it.

274
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:05,525
I've got you.

275
00:29:07,817 --> 00:29:09,025
Careful, careful.

276
00:29:18,609 --> 00:29:20,359
Now we're in camp. Sit down.

277
00:29:20,442 --> 00:29:21,275
You're alright.

278
00:29:22,525 --> 00:29:24,150
Nice one. Let's have a look at you.

279
00:29:25,234 --> 00:29:26,484
Hold still, hold still.

280
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:29,942
Yeah, you're going to be alright.

281
00:29:32,109 --> 00:29:33,942
Right, put pressure on it.
Don't let him get up.

282
00:29:46,775 --> 00:29:48,650
Katczinsky, back to work.

283
00:29:48,734 --> 00:29:50,275
And you? Are you injured?

284
00:29:50,775 --> 00:29:51,609
No.

285
00:29:52,109 --> 00:29:53,650
Then start gathering.

286
00:29:53,734 --> 00:29:55,400
Man, man, man!

287
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,400
No rest for the wicked.

288
00:30:05,067 --> 00:30:06,400
It's the same every day.

289
00:33:03,025 --> 00:33:04,775
Come on! Keep working!

290
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:06,775
We don't have all day.

291
00:34:21,484 --> 00:34:23,775
Albrecht, Karl. Diepholz.

292
00:34:23,859 --> 00:34:24,692
18 MONTHS LATER

293
00:34:24,775 --> 00:34:27,859
September 14th, 1898.

294
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:35,359
Blumenthal, Samuel.

295
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:40,609
Dresden. November 6th, 1900.

296
00:34:42,025 --> 00:34:43,400
Yesterday was his birthday.

297
00:34:47,275 --> 00:34:49,400
Von Gallwitz, Gustav.

298
00:34:50,484 --> 00:34:54,817
Osnabruck, June 20th, '99.

299
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,650
Gotz Luttwitz--

300
00:34:57,734 --> 00:34:58,609
That's enough.

301
00:35:08,275 --> 00:35:10,650
SUPREME ARMY COMMAND
7 NOVEMBER, 1918

302
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:12,567
-She's a looker.
-Let's see.

303
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:13,609
She's alright.

304
00:35:36,525 --> 00:35:37,567
Herr Erzberger.

305
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,317
God be with us.

306
00:35:49,484 --> 00:35:52,650
Once more, over 40,000 killed
in the last few weeks alone.

307
00:35:54,275 --> 00:35:56,234
That should convince the general staff.

308
00:35:57,775 --> 00:35:59,900
I think the gentlemen know it's over.

309
00:36:02,484 --> 00:36:03,567
We all know that.

310
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,234
The General Field Marshal.

311
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:14,275
Mm.

312
00:36:31,984 --> 00:36:36,025
CHAMPAGNE, FRANCE
OCCUPIED TERRITORY

313
00:36:56,359 --> 00:36:58,109
-Thank you.
-<i>Jawohl</i>.

314
00:37:10,775 --> 00:37:12,192
Paul, if we keep up this pace,

315
00:37:12,275 --> 00:37:14,692
we won't have conquered France
for 180 years.

316
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:18,484
I worked it out.

317
00:37:18,567 --> 00:37:20,150
Don't let them catch you, Kat.

318
00:37:21,859 --> 00:37:22,859
Never.

319
00:37:33,067 --> 00:37:33,900
Come on.

320
00:37:37,067 --> 00:37:39,234
Explain to me
how this is worth dying for in your mind.

321
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,984
When you're starving, you'll do anything.

322
00:38:25,234 --> 00:38:26,150
<i>Qui va la?</i>

323
00:38:28,942 --> 00:38:29,900
<i>Ho!</i>

324
00:38:30,525 --> 00:38:32,525
<i>Oh, putain!</i>

325
00:38:37,525 --> 00:38:40,400
<i>Attends je vais flinguer ce fumier!</i>

326
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:41,900
Kat?

327
00:38:44,525 --> 00:38:45,359
Kat?

328
00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:47,692
Run!

329
00:38:47,775 --> 00:38:49,234
Hey! Dirty Kraut!

330
00:38:49,942 --> 00:38:51,775
<i>-Rends-moi l'oie, ordure!</i>
-Run!

331
00:38:52,984 --> 00:38:54,150
<i>Fumier!</i>

332
00:39:11,234 --> 00:39:12,650
-Just right.
-I told you.

333
00:39:12,734 --> 00:39:13,942
Men, you are heroes.

334
00:39:14,025 --> 00:39:15,650
Shut the door or the others will smell it.

335
00:39:19,234 --> 00:39:20,067
Nice work.

336
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,192
I don't know. How am I
supposed to remember anything?

337
00:39:22,275 --> 00:39:23,609
Come on, use your Prussian brain.

338
00:39:23,692 --> 00:39:25,359
Here. Open-eyed and long-fingered.

339
00:39:25,442 --> 00:39:26,817
Help me with the goose.

340
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,859
A piece of goose from the goose.
From France to Franz.

341
00:39:29,942 --> 00:39:30,942
I want a wing.

342
00:39:31,025 --> 00:39:33,025
Do I have to share?
Then I'll take the rest.

343
00:39:33,109 --> 00:39:34,025
Fill up my bowl.

344
00:39:35,234 --> 00:39:38,400
Come here, you blind hen.
Wide-mouth frog…

345
00:39:38,484 --> 00:39:40,775
-Rest in peace in the drumfire.
-Ooh.

346
00:39:41,567 --> 00:39:42,900
Oh, God.

347
00:39:42,984 --> 00:39:44,609
You know I'll owe you forever for this.

348
00:39:46,067 --> 00:39:47,275
Mm.

349
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,567
It's not bad, is it?

350
00:40:13,525 --> 00:40:14,567
Yes. Mm.

351
00:40:15,609 --> 00:40:17,359
-And you?
-Yes. Yes, good.

352
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,525
It's good, Paul.

353
00:40:21,609 --> 00:40:22,650
Good, Kat.

354
00:40:22,734 --> 00:40:23,817
Life is short.

355
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,025
-Where's Emil when you need him?
-Emil, bring in coffee and caviar!

356
00:40:28,109 --> 00:40:31,067
Yes, and draw my foot bath as well.
I need a foot bath.

357
00:40:32,859 --> 00:40:34,734
-Kat?
-What is it?

358
00:40:42,567 --> 00:40:44,734
-The farmer! The farmer!
-The farmer! Yes!

359
00:41:16,775 --> 00:41:18,400
Tjaden sits very quietly and says…

360
00:41:18,484 --> 00:41:21,192
"Where is he?"
"Cross." I keep hearing, "Cross."

361
00:41:21,275 --> 00:41:23,317
"My father was leader of Nazareth."

362
00:41:23,859 --> 00:41:26,400
"Leader of Nazareth?"
enquires the teacher.

363
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,025
"What?" "Never heard of it."

364
00:41:28,109 --> 00:41:30,067
"Tjaden, go back home
and ask again, will you?"

365
00:41:30,567 --> 00:41:33,859
Next morning, Tjaden springs into school
and says to everybody,

366
00:41:33,942 --> 00:41:37,150
"Please forgive me."
"My father wasn't the leader of Nazareth."

367
00:41:37,692 --> 00:41:39,359
"My father was last seen with Nadja Roth."

368
00:41:43,317 --> 00:41:44,359
Brilliant.

369
00:41:50,692 --> 00:41:51,525
Look.

370
00:41:52,067 --> 00:41:52,900
Mhm?

371
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,859
<i>Regarder! </i>

372
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:16,817
Hey! Hello!

373
00:42:18,109 --> 00:42:19,150
Come here!

374
00:42:19,984 --> 00:42:21,317
Fresh baguette!

375
00:42:22,234 --> 00:42:23,109
For you!

376
00:42:23,775 --> 00:42:25,192
Liverwurst, love!

377
00:42:25,692 --> 00:42:26,859
Lots of love!

378
00:42:41,275 --> 00:42:42,859
Franz. What are you doing?

379
00:42:44,109 --> 00:42:47,317
-Take me with you.
-Come on!

380
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,817
I'd go over.

381
00:42:55,067 --> 00:42:56,525
But he's making a fool of himself.

382
00:42:57,692 --> 00:43:00,525
Oh, my.
You are very beautiful, my love.

383
00:43:02,317 --> 00:43:03,192
Franz!

384
00:43:03,275 --> 00:43:05,150
The dark-haired beauty
is for me!

385
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:16,359
What is he doing?

386
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:22,984
Franz!

387
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:26,025
Goodbye!

388
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:28,692
Goodbye, my friends!

389
00:43:39,275 --> 00:43:40,359
Damn it.

390
00:43:42,525 --> 00:43:45,484
If it was all over,
you know what I'd be doing?

391
00:43:45,567 --> 00:43:47,275
There's no peace,
so it doesn't matter.

392
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:48,525
No, but if there was…

393
00:43:49,234 --> 00:43:52,192
-We'd be surrounded by women again.
-Yeah, that's true.

394
00:43:53,234 --> 00:43:55,525
I wouldn't put trousers on
for eight days.

395
00:43:55,609 --> 00:43:58,817
I should really be spanking your backside
for talking about something like that.

396
00:43:58,900 --> 00:43:59,984
What about you, Paul?

397
00:44:01,442 --> 00:44:04,650
-No idea. Can't think.
-I'd stay with the Prussians.

398
00:44:05,192 --> 00:44:06,484
You're an idiot, Tjaden.

399
00:44:07,192 --> 00:44:08,900
Have you ever done
any peat digging?

400
00:44:08,984 --> 00:44:10,109
Try it sometime.

401
00:44:10,192 --> 00:44:12,484
Can't be worse
than digging trenches in Champagne.

402
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:14,525
It takes longer
than digging trenches in Champagne.

403
00:44:14,609 --> 00:44:16,234
And you can't get away with not doing it.

404
00:44:16,859 --> 00:44:19,484
In peacetime military life,
you have no concerns.

405
00:44:20,025 --> 00:44:22,525
Mornings, food's there
or else you're not there.

406
00:44:23,275 --> 00:44:24,984
And then you have the softest bed.

407
00:44:25,067 --> 00:44:26,859
Every week with fresh sheets over it.

408
00:44:26,942 --> 00:44:27,775
And then…

409
00:44:29,484 --> 00:44:31,067
And before you know it, I'm a corporal.

410
00:44:32,067 --> 00:44:35,150
Imagine that.
Me becoming a military policeman.

411
00:44:35,234 --> 00:44:37,067
A Cognac here, a pint there.

412
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:40,234
A military policeman
is everyone's good friend. Everyone.

413
00:44:40,317 --> 00:44:41,900
There's just one catch, Tjaden.

414
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:44,400
What's that?

415
00:44:44,484 --> 00:44:46,650
You'll never be a corporal though,
will you?

416
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,400
You always make such useless comments.

417
00:44:58,484 --> 00:45:00,109
What does it matter what you think anyway?

418
00:45:16,317 --> 00:45:17,984
-Kat! Kat!
-Here!

419
00:45:18,067 --> 00:45:19,109
-Kat!
-Here!

420
00:45:19,192 --> 00:45:20,109
Kat!

421
00:46:16,442 --> 00:46:17,317
"Darling one."

422
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:20,275
"You asked us
for a package of food to be sent."

423
00:46:21,067 --> 00:46:23,442
"Four portions of sausage
are on their way with lard."

424
00:46:25,859 --> 00:46:28,109
"A couple of pieces of cake."

425
00:46:29,192 --> 00:46:30,984
"Sauerkraut and smoked wurst."

426
00:46:31,942 --> 00:46:32,817
"Some more…"

427
00:46:33,984 --> 00:46:35,775
-Hing? Hingfong?
-Hingfong.

428
00:46:36,275 --> 00:46:37,400
"…and a cup of sugar."

429
00:46:38,609 --> 00:46:41,067
"Eggs and a glass of plum jam in there."

430
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:44,650
"Don't eat too quickly as I don't want
to have to send more right away."

431
00:46:45,817 --> 00:46:47,817
"I'd keep it away
from your comrades if I were you."

432
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,234
"My dear one."

433
00:46:51,234 --> 00:46:52,859
"I must also ask a question of you."

434
00:46:53,484 --> 00:46:55,359
"Have you started to save up any money?"

435
00:46:56,359 --> 00:46:58,359
"Could you send some home
would you think?"

436
00:46:59,192 --> 00:47:01,859
"People are saying the war
will be over soon." "Some people."

437
00:47:02,609 --> 00:47:04,817
"And so it would be helpful
to have some saved up."

438
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:07,734
"You're probably thinking,
'What is she after?'"

439
00:47:07,817 --> 00:47:09,525
"'How cheeky of her to ask.'"

440
00:47:10,359 --> 00:47:12,317
"But I mean not to offend you."

441
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,692
"You know me, I can never get enough."

442
00:47:15,275 --> 00:47:17,942
"But more, more." "I can't help it,
I always want some more."

443
00:47:18,609 --> 00:47:20,859
"So make sure not to fall over
before you can come home."

444
00:47:22,692 --> 00:47:25,984
"Karl Lemmer is in a hospital bed
somewhere in the East."

445
00:47:26,484 --> 00:47:27,609
"Something with his stomach."

446
00:47:28,192 --> 00:47:30,442
"And he was out there
for barely three weeks in total."

447
00:47:32,025 --> 00:47:34,484
"Can't you also be sick,
with your rheumatism?"

448
00:47:35,942 --> 00:47:37,734
"You've already played your role."

449
00:47:39,109 --> 00:47:42,275
If only she could see
how you're sitting there, with your cigar.

450
00:47:46,359 --> 00:47:48,067
"This Sunday, I'll visit the gra…"

451
00:47:54,734 --> 00:47:57,275
"This Sunday,
I'll visit the grave of our boy."

452
00:48:00,692 --> 00:48:03,775
"I'll make sure to read to him
as you remember he loved that."

453
00:48:05,859 --> 00:48:09,359
"By next year, we'll be able to celebrate
his tenth birthday together."

454
00:48:12,192 --> 00:48:13,817
"That's all I have to tell you this time."

455
00:48:14,567 --> 00:48:16,817
"Sending kisses from your wife, for you."

456
00:48:17,525 --> 00:48:18,442
"<i>Auf Wiedersehen</i>."

457
00:48:24,984 --> 00:48:25,900
I had no idea.

458
00:48:35,317 --> 00:48:36,650
Oh, Paul.

459
00:48:41,734 --> 00:48:43,359
How is all this going to work out, hmm?

460
00:48:45,275 --> 00:48:46,650
Returning to a home,

461
00:48:47,984 --> 00:48:49,900
having to go back to our normal being.

462
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:54,109
Where all everyone wants to know about
are the battles we've been in.

463
00:48:56,942 --> 00:49:00,275
We'll be like travellers
who belong in another country elsewhere.

464
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,650
Sometimes I wonder…

465
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:06,692
Would…

466
00:49:06,775 --> 00:49:10,150
Would I be happier with you here at camp?

467
00:49:10,234 --> 00:49:11,984
Tjaden and Kropp.

468
00:49:13,192 --> 00:49:15,067
And with Muller. He'd be sat with us.

469
00:49:16,775 --> 00:49:18,317
And be eating fried potatoes.

470
00:49:19,109 --> 00:49:20,067
Unpeeled.

471
00:49:27,067 --> 00:49:28,109
Well…

472
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,025
That's enough of that.

473
00:49:43,859 --> 00:49:46,192
How long until we finally get going again?

474
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:49,817
How long
until we finally get going again?

475
00:50:08,359 --> 00:50:09,234
Franz?

476
00:50:09,984 --> 00:50:10,817
Yes?

477
00:50:12,484 --> 00:50:14,234
Tomorrow, we're up at six o'clock.

478
00:50:14,317 --> 00:50:15,859
To look for some children.

479
00:50:16,692 --> 00:50:17,609
What happened?

480
00:50:19,275 --> 00:50:20,817
They should have arrived today.

481
00:50:21,317 --> 00:50:22,359
A whole company.

482
00:50:27,234 --> 00:50:28,067
How was it?

483
00:50:32,359 --> 00:50:33,650
-Good.
-Yeah?

484
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,234
Yes.

485
00:50:37,692 --> 00:50:38,525
Here.

486
00:50:43,942 --> 00:50:44,817
Have a smell.

487
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:58,734
What's her name?

488
00:50:58,817 --> 00:50:59,817
Eloise.

489
00:51:02,567 --> 00:51:03,484
Eloise.

490
00:51:04,525 --> 00:51:07,692
She had skin as white as milk.

491
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:11,650
Breasts…

492
00:51:13,234 --> 00:51:14,484
-Hey.
-Huh?

493
00:51:15,067 --> 00:51:16,317
I want to smell it too.

494
00:51:20,192 --> 00:51:21,192
Kropp, let me have it.

495
00:51:22,025 --> 00:51:23,775
-Here.
-Oh, my.

496
00:51:23,859 --> 00:51:24,734
Give it to me.

497
00:51:24,817 --> 00:51:27,692
A girl like that
never has dirt under her nails.

498
00:51:27,775 --> 00:51:30,067
-No.
-At worst, some sand from the seashore.

499
00:51:30,734 --> 00:51:31,942
Tjaden.

500
00:51:32,025 --> 00:51:34,567
-Come on, pass it here.
-I bet she bathes twice a day.

501
00:51:38,859 --> 00:51:41,150
Tjaden, give it back to me.

502
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,234
Sir.

503
00:52:05,692 --> 00:52:06,859
Call the others.

504
00:52:45,734 --> 00:52:47,317
There must have been a huge explosion.

505
00:52:48,442 --> 00:52:49,859
Mine thrower cannons.

506
00:52:50,525 --> 00:52:52,650
He's been blasted
right out of his uniform.

507
00:52:58,067 --> 00:52:59,609
Was he one of those we've come here for?

508
00:53:00,234 --> 00:53:02,567
No, they've only been missing
since yesterday.

509
00:53:03,567 --> 00:53:05,359
He's been hanging there
for some time.

510
00:53:06,192 --> 00:53:07,109
Not pleasant.

511
00:53:07,942 --> 00:53:09,359
Don't get soft now, men.

512
00:53:10,025 --> 00:53:11,400
How many are we looking for?

513
00:53:11,484 --> 00:53:13,025
Sixty young recruits.

514
00:53:20,525 --> 00:53:21,942
Breakfast is turnip bread.

515
00:53:22,442 --> 00:53:23,900
Same at lunchtime, it's turnip bread.

516
00:53:23,984 --> 00:53:26,567
I'm surrounded by turnip bread.
I can't face it any more.

517
00:53:27,192 --> 00:53:29,942
Let me know when you find them.
I'm not going any further.

518
00:53:30,859 --> 00:53:31,734
Gas.

519
00:53:35,025 --> 00:53:36,067
There was gas here.

520
00:54:18,734 --> 00:54:19,984
Shit!

521
00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:56,650
Hello, madam.

522
00:55:00,275 --> 00:55:01,275
I'm Kropp.

523
00:55:05,775 --> 00:55:06,692
And you?

524
00:55:13,567 --> 00:55:14,442
Mm.

525
00:55:19,067 --> 00:55:19,900
Do you want to…

526
00:55:24,317 --> 00:55:25,900
Do you want to come with me?

527
00:55:28,067 --> 00:55:28,900
Not a problem.

528
00:56:23,317 --> 00:56:24,234
Kat?

529
00:56:27,067 --> 00:56:27,984
Kat.

530
00:56:29,734 --> 00:56:30,567
Kat!

531
00:56:40,567 --> 00:56:41,567
Shit.

532
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:49,650
-Flipping idiots.
-Uh huh.

533
00:56:50,525 --> 00:56:53,192
Stupid boys.
They took their masks off too soon.

534
00:56:56,609 --> 00:56:58,150
Germany will soon be empty.

535
00:57:15,650 --> 00:57:19,775
COMPIEGNE, FRANCE
8 NOVEMBER, 1918

536
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:22,192
General.

537
00:58:24,692 --> 00:58:26,317
Well, Brixdorf, what's the latest?

538
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,025
The French are increasing the pressure.

539
00:58:28,109 --> 00:58:30,817
Early this morning,
our reconnaissance intercepted orders

540
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:33,234
summoning entire divisions to Latierre.

541
00:58:33,317 --> 00:58:36,067
A tank fleet is still reportedly
still stuck at Fernancourt.

542
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:37,859
Must mean an attack is likely.

543
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:42,400
The social democrats
will be the end of mankind, Brixdorf.

544
00:58:44,942 --> 00:58:45,859
General?

545
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,317
I have just put a German delegation
to the armistice negotiations

546
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:54,900
on the train to Compiegne.

547
00:59:02,025 --> 00:59:05,484
These people, Brixdorf,
are selling out our fatherland.

548
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:08,567
My orders are war.

549
00:59:09,775 --> 00:59:13,317
And all the while that is the case,
I shall fight for every meter.

550
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:18,067
We have to hold on now
and wait for fresh troops.

551
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:20,900
In a few months, the incoming class
of recruits will be here.

552
00:59:22,109 --> 00:59:23,942
The French are trying everything they can

553
00:59:24,025 --> 00:59:26,567
to force
their completely unacceptable terms on us.

554
00:59:29,192 --> 00:59:30,859
I will not capitulate.

555
00:59:33,734 --> 00:59:36,650
We must strike without delay.
With all our might.

556
00:59:41,984 --> 00:59:42,900
General.

557
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:06,484
From our position,

558
01:00:08,317 --> 01:00:09,775
I have to be clear…

559
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:12,317
We all have to be clear…

560
01:00:13,775 --> 01:00:14,859
For God's sake.

561
01:00:15,442 --> 01:00:16,359
Shit.

562
01:00:48,859 --> 01:00:49,692
Sir!

563
01:01:00,442 --> 01:01:02,109
Soldiers, pack your bags,

564
01:01:02,192 --> 01:01:04,942
roll up your bedding,
and wash your mess kits.

565
01:01:05,025 --> 01:01:08,317
The whole regiment will advance
to the front firing position.

566
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,567
And I mean everyone
who's able to stand on two legs is going.

567
01:01:12,734 --> 01:01:14,775
Line up, for God's sake.

568
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:18,567
You think the Frenchies will wait
for you to comb your pubes?

569
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:20,317
-Here we go again.
-Get moving!

570
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:23,025
-Where to?
-Where to? Where to?

571
01:01:23,525 --> 01:01:24,525
Into battle.

572
01:02:59,775 --> 01:03:01,650
Monsieur le Marechal is awaiting you.

573
01:04:09,359 --> 01:04:10,525
I'll come back for you.

574
01:04:26,067 --> 01:04:27,150
Envious, huh?

575
01:04:45,275 --> 01:04:46,525
I stand before you

576
01:04:47,067 --> 01:04:50,984
in the hope that you will take
our presence here today as an opportunity

577
01:04:51,067 --> 01:04:53,734
to take action to suspend all hostilities.

578
01:04:55,192 --> 01:04:56,734
In the name of humanity,

579
01:04:57,525 --> 01:05:00,525
I'm here asking you for an agreement
to an immediate cease-fire

580
01:05:00,609 --> 01:05:03,692
for the entire duration
of our negotiating time

581
01:05:03,775 --> 01:05:07,150
in order to spare
our nation's unnecessary depletion.

582
01:05:09,150 --> 01:05:12,400
Matthias Erzberger,
head of the German delegation.

583
01:05:22,317 --> 01:05:24,234
Weygand,
what do these gentlemen want?

584
01:05:25,150 --> 01:05:26,650
I don't know.

585
01:05:26,734 --> 01:05:29,609
Marshal Foch asks
what brings you gentlemen to him.

586
01:05:33,609 --> 01:05:35,650
We are here looking forward to hearing

587
01:05:36,484 --> 01:05:39,234
your proposal for an enduring cease-fire

588
01:05:39,317 --> 01:05:42,442
that will include all those on the water,
on land, as well as in the sky.

589
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:48,650
I have no proposal
of this kind to make.

590
01:05:51,692 --> 01:05:52,775
What does he mean by that?

591
01:05:53,609 --> 01:05:56,775
I think he disliked the phrasing
of what you said.

592
01:05:58,317 --> 01:05:59,234
Yes.

593
01:05:59,734 --> 01:06:00,942
Good, then…

594
01:06:04,525 --> 01:06:05,609
Monsieur Le Marechal,

595
01:06:05,692 --> 01:06:09,359
If you please,
we would like to know the conditions--

596
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,484
He wants you
to ask for it, formally.

597
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:29,359
Monsieur le Marechal,

598
01:06:31,734 --> 01:06:33,692
I am asking you for an armistice.

599
01:06:35,442 --> 01:06:38,025
We are asking
for an armistice.

600
01:06:43,650 --> 01:06:45,775
You have 72 hours
to accept our conditions.

601
01:06:45,859 --> 01:06:47,984
You have 72 hours
to accept our conditions.

602
01:06:48,067 --> 01:06:49,984
They are non-negotiable.

603
01:06:50,067 --> 01:06:51,442
Seventy-two hours?

604
01:06:51,525 --> 01:06:53,150
The war will continue until you sign them.

605
01:06:53,234 --> 01:06:54,317
Monsieur le Marechal,

606
01:06:54,817 --> 01:06:58,109
in God's name,
don't let 72 hours pass us by here.

607
01:06:59,609 --> 01:07:01,984
Thousands of lives depend on it.

608
01:07:07,942 --> 01:07:08,942
Sign then.

609
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:25,859
Understood.

610
01:07:44,942 --> 01:07:46,567
-Soldiers, we'll march.
-Sir.

611
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:51,025
Soldiers, march.

612
01:07:52,317 --> 01:07:53,317
March, soldiers.

613
01:07:56,317 --> 01:07:57,400
Soldiers, march.

614
01:07:58,859 --> 01:08:00,150
Off you go, get out of here.

615
01:08:01,275 --> 01:08:02,234
March, soldiers.

616
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:04,775
March.

617
01:08:05,817 --> 01:08:06,775
Soldiers, march.

618
01:08:08,317 --> 01:08:09,942
March, soldiers. Off you go.

619
01:08:59,942 --> 01:09:01,234
Go, go, go!

620
01:09:29,984 --> 01:09:31,650
<i>Atencion aux arbaletes…</i>

621
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,734
<i>Allez! Allez les gars!</i>

622
01:09:59,234 --> 01:10:00,192
<i>Allez! Allez!</i>

623
01:10:30,359 --> 01:10:33,192
Keep going, Paul. Come on. Paul!

624
01:10:40,650 --> 01:10:41,609
<i>Allez!</i>

625
01:10:50,192 --> 01:10:51,775
<i>Au renfort!</i>

626
01:11:10,109 --> 01:11:11,484
<i>Putain, putain, non, non!</i>

627
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:57,317
Get out!

628
01:12:03,025 --> 01:12:04,234
What is that?

629
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:06,234
Get out!

630
01:12:08,150 --> 01:12:10,234
-Here!
-Quick, quick, quick! Move it!

631
01:12:10,317 --> 01:12:11,525
Get out!

632
01:12:11,609 --> 01:12:12,442
There, there, look!

633
01:12:12,525 --> 01:12:13,525
-What is it?
-Down there.

634
01:12:13,609 --> 01:12:14,442
What is it?

635
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:50,275
Open fire!

636
01:12:51,067 --> 01:12:52,900
Open fire!

637
01:13:34,567 --> 01:13:36,150
All down!

638
01:13:36,234 --> 01:13:37,359
Get down!

639
01:14:02,775 --> 01:14:04,817
Boys, think fast! Be smart!

640
01:14:27,442 --> 01:14:28,692
Get the hand grenades out!

641
01:14:29,525 --> 01:14:31,900
Throw them in the vehicle
when they're on top of us.

642
01:14:59,317 --> 01:15:00,150
Get out!

643
01:15:01,067 --> 01:15:02,109
Get up!

644
01:15:10,650 --> 01:15:11,484
Franz!

645
01:15:11,567 --> 01:15:13,067
Follow me. Come on, follow me!

646
01:15:15,192 --> 01:15:16,067
Franz!

647
01:15:17,192 --> 01:15:18,275
Paul!

648
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:03,609
Paul.

649
01:16:03,692 --> 01:16:04,692
Paul!

650
01:16:20,525 --> 01:16:21,734
Open fire!

651
01:16:35,150 --> 01:16:36,567
Retreat!

652
01:16:37,817 --> 01:16:38,900
Retreat!

653
01:17:54,609 --> 01:17:57,234
No, no, no! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! No!

654
01:17:57,317 --> 01:18:00,109
Please, please, no! No, no, no!

655
01:18:00,192 --> 01:18:03,234
No, wait, wait, don't shoot.
Don't shoot. Don't shoot. No.

656
01:18:03,317 --> 01:18:04,234
-No, no!
-Albert.

657
01:18:12,567 --> 01:18:14,692
Come on, come on.

658
01:18:14,775 --> 01:18:16,150
Come on!

659
01:18:21,859 --> 01:18:22,817
Keep going!

660
01:18:49,067 --> 01:18:50,317
Where is Franz?

661
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:51,650
I've left Franz alone!

662
01:18:59,150 --> 01:19:00,275
Katczinsky!

663
01:19:00,984 --> 01:19:02,734
Take the machine gun and retreat.

664
01:19:02,817 --> 01:19:05,567
We'll regroup in Eguisac,
two kilometres northeast.

665
01:19:07,984 --> 01:19:10,650
I miss my comrades, sir. I miss them all!

666
01:19:11,234 --> 01:19:13,025
I miss my mother, for God's sake.

667
01:19:13,109 --> 01:19:15,650
Grenades, ammunition! Come on!

668
01:19:17,525 --> 01:19:18,650
Paul, come on!

669
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:28,859
Get out of here! Let's go!

670
01:19:46,609 --> 01:19:49,234
These aren't negotiations,
this is a dictate.

671
01:19:49,317 --> 01:19:52,650
Maybe we should return to Spa
to consult with the general staff.

672
01:19:52,734 --> 01:19:54,692
And what expectations
do you have for that?

673
01:19:54,775 --> 01:19:57,150
Even if we end up
losing definitively after all,

674
01:19:57,234 --> 01:19:59,567
we won't be worse off
than we are with this surrender.

675
01:19:59,650 --> 01:20:01,650
Except for
a few hundred thousand extra deaths.

676
01:20:01,734 --> 01:20:03,567
Alsace-Lorraine,
occupation of the Rhineland,

677
01:20:03,650 --> 01:20:05,817
cannons, locomotives,
trains, and whatever else.

678
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:08,025
You are aware,
this is a total capitulation.

679
01:20:08,109 --> 01:20:12,442
250,000 Americans
are landing each month in Europe.

680
01:20:12,525 --> 01:20:16,067
Marne, Cantigny, Cambrai.
All of those lost.

681
01:20:17,109 --> 01:20:19,109
All that's left
separating us from an armistice

682
01:20:19,192 --> 01:20:20,775
is false pride, as I see it.

683
01:20:20,859 --> 01:20:22,192
Thanks to you and your commanders,

684
01:20:22,275 --> 01:20:24,442
we're here dealing with the mess
left by them.

685
01:20:24,525 --> 01:20:26,984
I'm happy for you to depart here,
it's down to you.

686
01:20:27,067 --> 01:20:28,192
We are remaining here.

687
01:20:34,650 --> 01:20:35,734
It is winter.

688
01:20:36,984 --> 01:20:40,025
Without trains and provisions,
Bolshevism will take over.

689
01:20:40,859 --> 01:20:42,859
On their way home,
the men will die of hunger

690
01:20:42,942 --> 01:20:45,359
instead of dying
with honour on the battlefield.

691
01:20:46,609 --> 01:20:47,484
Honour?

692
01:20:49,442 --> 01:20:52,275
My son was killed in the war.
He doesn't feel any honour.

693
01:20:58,567 --> 01:20:59,692
Von Helldorf.

694
01:21:00,692 --> 01:21:03,109
Please get a few copies
of the conditions of their proposal

695
01:21:03,192 --> 01:21:05,359
and telegraph them to headquarters.

696
01:21:05,442 --> 01:21:06,775
You inform the government.

697
01:21:10,275 --> 01:21:12,317
We have 72 hours left here, gentlemen,

698
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,734
and during every minute
we waste by talking about it,

699
01:21:14,817 --> 01:21:16,275
there dies another soldier.

700
01:21:17,192 --> 01:21:20,650
Let us gain mercy where we can,
but for God's sake,

701
01:21:21,484 --> 01:21:22,567
let's make peace.

702
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:10,234
Retreat! Retreat!

703
01:22:15,234 --> 01:22:17,317
Run! Run!

704
01:22:17,817 --> 01:22:20,067
Keep firing!

705
01:23:19,067 --> 01:23:20,109
Shut up!

706
01:24:04,442 --> 01:24:05,442
Shut up!

707
01:24:08,650 --> 01:24:09,775
That's enough!

708
01:26:05,484 --> 01:26:06,692
No, no, no.

709
01:26:07,317 --> 01:26:08,150
Comrade.

710
01:26:09,234 --> 01:26:11,192
Comrade, comrade.

711
01:27:13,609 --> 01:27:14,525
So sorry.

712
01:27:15,942 --> 01:27:17,025
So sorry.

713
01:27:17,984 --> 01:27:20,192
I am so sorry. I am so sorry.

714
01:27:57,734 --> 01:28:00,275
DUVAL, GERARD
TYPOGRAPHER

715
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:15,859
Your wife…

716
01:28:17,859 --> 01:28:18,984
Your wife…

717
01:28:20,609 --> 01:28:22,275
I promise… I promise…

718
01:28:23,692 --> 01:28:24,650
I promise…

719
01:30:12,484 --> 01:30:14,109
When were you born, Brixdorf?

720
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:18,275
1877, in June.

721
01:30:20,275 --> 01:30:21,692
A summer child.

722
01:30:22,775 --> 01:30:23,609
Yes.

723
01:30:26,859 --> 01:30:28,067
What about your father?

724
01:30:30,359 --> 01:30:32,609
My family live in Holstein
and he has a factory there.

725
01:30:33,150 --> 01:30:35,525
Producing what?

726
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:38,692
Riding saddles, general.

727
01:30:39,192 --> 01:30:40,359
Riding saddles.

728
01:30:42,067 --> 01:30:45,442
Something that will always sell.
Your future is secure then.

729
01:30:47,109 --> 01:30:48,442
I am indeed fortunate.

730
01:30:50,817 --> 01:30:51,692
And?

731
01:30:52,650 --> 01:30:54,234
Are you looking forward to going home?

732
01:30:55,525 --> 01:30:57,900
-When we are no longer needed here?
-Yes.

733
01:30:59,567 --> 01:31:02,734
After the war,
a position of responsibility awaits me.

734
01:31:03,567 --> 01:31:05,650
-I will take over the business.
-Mhm.

735
01:31:06,817 --> 01:31:07,942
Congratulations.

736
01:31:08,567 --> 01:31:09,484
And you?

737
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:12,984
I'm a soldier.

738
01:31:14,817 --> 01:31:17,067
My father was an officer in this regiment.

739
01:31:18,317 --> 01:31:20,525
He fought in the three wars
under Bismarck.

740
01:31:21,234 --> 01:31:22,692
He won all three of them.

741
01:31:23,275 --> 01:31:25,567
In 1871, he marched on Paris

742
01:31:26,234 --> 01:31:28,067
and when he returned, he was a hero.

743
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:34,109
I was too late in being born, Brixdorf.

744
01:31:35,775 --> 01:31:37,734
It's been 50 years of no war.

745
01:31:39,150 --> 01:31:40,692
What is a soldier without war?

746
01:31:47,859 --> 01:31:49,484
Were you and your father close?

747
01:31:50,984 --> 01:31:52,442
As a child, maybe.

748
01:31:54,692 --> 01:31:56,859
A man is alone when born.

749
01:31:57,484 --> 01:31:58,567
He lives alone

750
01:31:59,650 --> 01:32:01,192
and on his deathbed is alone.

751
01:32:31,150 --> 01:32:32,275
THE KAISER HAS ABDICATED

752
01:32:32,359 --> 01:32:33,984
Come in.

753
01:32:35,359 --> 01:32:38,484
-Von Helldorf. How can I help you?
-Hindenburg.

754
01:32:38,567 --> 01:32:39,859
Open it immediately.

755
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:47,775
He urges us to sign.

756
01:32:51,275 --> 01:32:53,525
-It's over!
-We're going home!

757
01:32:53,609 --> 01:32:55,817
We're going home!

758
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:58,067
Back to our families.

759
01:33:06,442 --> 01:33:10,942
In the name of all
who are living in a world of sin.

760
01:33:11,025 --> 01:33:14,650
We are surrounded by it now in the filth.

761
01:33:16,900 --> 01:33:18,234
Knock on the monastery's door

762
01:33:18,317 --> 01:33:21,484
and you'll find
only thieves and scoundrels.

763
01:33:21,567 --> 01:33:24,359
It's finally over.
The fat pigs finally get it.

764
01:33:24,442 --> 01:33:28,609
They're negotiating at last.
We're going home soon, do you hear that?

765
01:33:33,317 --> 01:33:34,900
Are there any sergeants left?

766
01:33:44,150 --> 01:33:46,234
Chloroform the man,
for God's sake.

767
01:34:00,525 --> 01:34:01,442
Baumer.

768
01:34:02,609 --> 01:34:03,442
Baumer.

769
01:34:08,734 --> 01:34:09,817
Baumer.

770
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:11,525
Tjaden? Tjaden.

771
01:34:13,775 --> 01:34:14,775
What happened?

772
01:34:15,442 --> 01:34:16,442
Where have you been hit?

773
01:34:16,525 --> 01:34:17,609
Above the knee.

774
01:34:18,859 --> 01:34:20,317
Or somewhere down there.

775
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:21,775
I can't feel anything.

776
01:34:22,692 --> 01:34:24,275
How far up is the shot?

777
01:34:25,317 --> 01:34:26,650
I can't raise my head.

778
01:34:28,650 --> 01:34:30,109
Ten centimetres, it seems.

779
01:34:34,859 --> 01:34:36,067
You're going home soon, Tjaden.

780
01:34:36,150 --> 01:34:38,109
-You think so?
-Yes, you are.

781
01:34:42,817 --> 01:34:45,150
It's unlikely the police force
will have me, though.

782
01:34:47,150 --> 01:34:48,275
God damn shit.

783
01:34:49,484 --> 01:34:50,859
You can still do it.

784
01:34:53,025 --> 01:34:54,150
Just wait and see.

785
01:34:54,942 --> 01:34:56,859
I'm not going to let them amputate me.

786
01:34:58,275 --> 01:35:00,234
I'm not living as a cripple in this world.

787
01:35:00,775 --> 01:35:02,025
You won't have to.

788
01:35:02,109 --> 01:35:04,359
There are others who are worse off
that they've patched up.

789
01:35:08,734 --> 01:35:10,234
Oh, dear Paul.

790
01:35:10,942 --> 01:35:12,400
I have something to give you.

791
01:35:44,317 --> 01:35:45,275
Is he dead?

792
01:35:51,067 --> 01:35:52,692
You must show braveness.

793
01:35:54,359 --> 01:35:55,609
You're alive, remember?

794
01:35:55,692 --> 01:35:57,525
For that, you have to be grateful.

795
01:35:58,359 --> 01:35:59,359
For us.

796
01:35:59,442 --> 01:36:01,734
-For those who didn't make it.
-That's enough.

797
01:36:01,817 --> 01:36:04,317
Look here. You mustn't say that. Not you.

798
01:36:19,775 --> 01:36:21,067
Good feeling, right?

799
01:36:22,275 --> 01:36:23,359
Have a bit of that, then.

800
01:36:23,942 --> 01:36:25,650
Yeah,
dry your socks out there.

801
01:36:26,150 --> 01:36:27,734
The way the last summer was…

802
01:36:32,484 --> 01:36:33,567
Right, none…

803
01:36:35,775 --> 01:36:36,859
You see?

804
01:36:36,942 --> 01:36:38,359
Not like the last one.

805
01:36:39,734 --> 01:36:41,484
That was too…

806
01:36:44,775 --> 01:36:46,567
You always blame me.

807
01:36:46,650 --> 01:36:49,484
-We saw you!
--What did you see me doing?

808
01:36:50,609 --> 01:36:51,650
Come on!

809
01:36:52,775 --> 01:36:54,150
Nah, we know it was you.

810
01:36:54,234 --> 01:36:55,859
Why is it always on me?

811
01:37:10,484 --> 01:37:12,900
Do you have shit for brains?
Why won't you listen?

812
01:37:13,442 --> 01:37:15,567
You have been given
a second company's provisions.

813
01:37:16,192 --> 01:37:18,775
We are that second company!

814
01:37:18,859 --> 01:37:20,942
So dish it out! Give it to us!

815
01:37:21,025 --> 01:37:21,942
Kat?

816
01:37:22,734 --> 01:37:23,900
-Kat!
-Paul?

817
01:37:23,984 --> 01:37:24,817
Kat!

818
01:37:25,692 --> 01:37:26,609
Paul!

819
01:37:27,192 --> 01:37:28,817
-Paul!
-Kat, you were alive.

820
01:37:28,900 --> 01:37:30,525
-Paul!
-You're alive!

821
01:37:30,609 --> 01:37:31,525
Paul.

822
01:37:39,859 --> 01:37:41,109
Tjaden was hit.

823
01:37:41,192 --> 01:37:42,484
He's lying inside the church.

824
01:37:43,984 --> 01:37:45,650
He'll get a double portion from us.

825
01:37:45,734 --> 01:37:46,609
Yes.

826
01:37:51,109 --> 01:37:52,775
Another one. In here.

827
01:37:55,484 --> 01:37:58,567
-I thought you were dead.
-Ha!

828
01:37:59,525 --> 01:38:00,900
At some point, we'll all die.

829
01:38:01,942 --> 01:38:03,317
But not on the home stretch.

830
01:38:05,609 --> 01:38:07,317
If you die before me, I'll kill you.

831
01:38:08,734 --> 01:38:10,567
Ha!

832
01:38:13,817 --> 01:38:14,650
Tjaden.

833
01:38:16,775 --> 01:38:17,692
Tjaden.

834
01:38:21,900 --> 01:38:22,734
Yes.

835
01:38:23,525 --> 01:38:24,734
-Kat?
-Yes.

836
01:38:29,067 --> 01:38:30,817
Kat.

837
01:38:30,900 --> 01:38:32,400
I've soup here for you.

838
01:38:32,484 --> 01:38:33,900
Have you brought cutlery?

839
01:38:33,984 --> 01:38:36,109
Yes, we brought cutlery as well.

840
01:38:41,484 --> 01:38:42,900
There you go. Eat up.

841
01:39:07,317 --> 01:39:09,817
Stop, stop, Tjaden, Tjaden!

842
01:39:10,317 --> 01:39:11,317
Stop!

843
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:16,609
We need help over here!

844
01:39:17,859 --> 01:39:19,275
What made you do that?

845
01:39:19,359 --> 01:39:20,275
Why would you?

846
01:39:21,192 --> 01:39:22,942
It's over for me.

847
01:39:23,025 --> 01:39:24,400
He's bleeding out!

848
01:39:29,359 --> 01:39:30,234
Tjaden.

849
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:36,275
Tjaden.

850
01:41:10,859 --> 01:41:11,775
What is it?

851
01:41:14,025 --> 01:41:15,109
I've lost something.

852
01:41:19,984 --> 01:41:21,359
Kat, do you speak French?

853
01:41:22,025 --> 01:41:24,275
Mm.
<i>S'il vous plait. S'il vous plait.</i>

854
01:41:28,567 --> 01:41:30,650
My mother always said
it was French I should learn.

855
01:41:30,734 --> 01:41:31,609
Aha.

856
01:41:35,025 --> 01:41:35,984
And the piano.

857
01:41:38,525 --> 01:41:40,067
She also warned me of war.

858
01:41:40,567 --> 01:41:41,692
She didn't want me to go.

859
01:41:41,775 --> 01:41:44,650
"That's not for you," she always said.
"You'll be dead in no time."

860
01:41:47,067 --> 01:41:48,692
I wanted to show that I could do it.

861
01:41:49,692 --> 01:41:51,109
What use is that now?

862
01:41:54,692 --> 01:41:56,567
"A couple of weeks, we'll be in Paris."

863
01:41:59,317 --> 01:42:02,359
These past two years of grenades
can't be shed like an item of clothing.

864
01:42:02,442 --> 01:42:05,109
-Paul.
-The stench will remain on us forever.

865
01:42:05,192 --> 01:42:07,109
-Enough.
-Ludwig is dead. Franz is dead. Albert--

866
01:42:07,192 --> 01:42:08,525
Is that to do with us?

867
01:42:09,734 --> 01:42:11,317
They don't suffer any more.

868
01:42:11,817 --> 01:42:12,775
Peace for them.

869
01:42:14,942 --> 01:42:16,442
We're still alive.

870
01:42:20,859 --> 01:42:22,525
Everything here is like a fever.

871
01:42:23,275 --> 01:42:25,400
Not one person wants it
but suddenly it's there.

872
01:42:26,609 --> 01:42:28,775
We didn't ask for it.
The others didn't ask for it.

873
01:42:28,859 --> 01:42:30,067
But nonetheless it happened

874
01:42:30,150 --> 01:42:32,150
and nonetheless half the world
is involved, mind you.

875
01:42:32,234 --> 01:42:33,359
God looks down

876
01:42:34,775 --> 01:42:36,067
at us murderers.

877
01:42:40,484 --> 01:42:41,484
Yeah, well.

878
01:42:45,234 --> 01:42:46,359
But what do I know?

879
01:42:46,942 --> 01:42:47,859
Nothing.

880
01:42:48,650 --> 01:42:50,192
I'm a pair of boots with a rifle.

881
01:42:52,442 --> 01:42:54,400
Get some rest. We're the lucky ones.

882
01:42:54,900 --> 01:42:55,734
Yes.

883
01:43:13,775 --> 01:43:14,650
Kat?

884
01:43:15,609 --> 01:43:16,692
Mm.

885
01:43:18,817 --> 01:43:20,150
What did your son die of?

886
01:43:25,567 --> 01:43:26,400
The pox.

887
01:43:35,025 --> 01:43:36,692
I'm afraid of what's to come.

888
01:43:44,067 --> 01:43:44,984
Don't be.

889
01:44:17,192 --> 01:44:18,109
Henri.

890
01:44:21,692 --> 01:44:22,817
Taste it.

891
01:44:26,817 --> 01:44:27,900
Were they made today?

892
01:44:30,900 --> 01:44:32,859
I'm sorry, sir. I don't think so.

893
01:44:33,859 --> 01:44:34,692
Hmm.

894
01:44:57,275 --> 01:44:58,442
Monsieur le Marechal.

895
01:45:05,859 --> 01:45:06,984
I'm listening.

896
01:45:07,067 --> 01:45:09,025
The Kaiser
has abdicated.

897
01:45:09,109 --> 01:45:13,650
Soldiers are refusing to obey orders.
Deserters are roaming the countryside.

898
01:45:13,734 --> 01:45:16,234
The new government
will do everything it can

899
01:45:16,317 --> 01:45:18,859
to fulfil the duties imposed on it,

900
01:45:18,942 --> 01:45:22,692
but the population,
through no fault of its own,

901
01:45:23,359 --> 01:45:25,734
faces hunger and anarchy setting in.

902
01:45:25,817 --> 01:45:29,025
This is a disease
of the defeated, not of the victorious.

903
01:45:29,109 --> 01:45:30,484
I don't fear it.

904
01:45:30,567 --> 01:45:32,192
I reject any compromise.

905
01:45:32,275 --> 01:45:33,859
I reject any compromise.

906
01:45:33,942 --> 01:45:36,025
Monsieur le Marechal, please.

907
01:45:37,234 --> 01:45:40,484
Be fair to your opponent
or else this peace will be hated.

908
01:45:40,567 --> 01:45:41,525
Fair?

909
01:45:44,859 --> 01:45:46,442
You speak of fairness?

910
01:46:00,609 --> 01:46:01,734
Sign it.

911
01:47:06,234 --> 01:47:07,650
Let the minutes record.

912
01:47:09,275 --> 01:47:13,067
The armistice here signed
shall take effect in six hours from now

913
01:47:13,150 --> 01:47:16,900
at the eleventh hour, on the eleventh day
of the eleventh month.

914
01:47:19,359 --> 01:47:20,650
Very good.

915
01:47:21,275 --> 01:47:22,400
The war is over.

916
01:47:36,567 --> 01:47:38,567
What are you going to do now?

917
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:41,984
What do you see here, Brixdorf?

918
01:47:44,234 --> 01:47:46,025
The plains of Latierre, general.

919
01:47:46,109 --> 01:47:46,984
Eguisac.

920
01:47:47,984 --> 01:47:49,234
I see them too.

921
01:47:50,442 --> 01:47:53,150
But also German soldiers
running away like cowards.

922
01:47:55,025 --> 01:47:57,317
The French troops are farting
on our position in Latierre

923
01:47:57,400 --> 01:47:59,942
and outside there's a train
crammed full of horse fuckers

924
01:48:00,025 --> 01:48:01,317
who are selling the homeland off.

925
01:48:05,525 --> 01:48:07,442
See to it that all recruits are withdrawn.

926
01:48:08,734 --> 01:48:10,067
Have them all report here.

927
01:48:10,734 --> 01:48:13,275
We're going to sort out this pile of shit!

928
01:48:24,067 --> 01:48:28,400
<i>Any communication</i>
<i>with the enemy remains prohibited.</i>

929
01:48:28,484 --> 01:48:33,400
<i>Firstly, hostilities on the entire front</i>
<i>will be ceased this morning,</i>

930
01:48:33,484 --> 01:48:35,650
<i>November 11th at eleven o'clock.</i>

931
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:39,067
<i>Secondly, the troops</i>
<i>will not cross the line reached</i>

932
01:48:39,150 --> 01:48:41,275
<i>on this day at this hour.</i>

933
01:48:41,359 --> 01:48:45,484
<i>The front line</i>
<i>shall remain unchanged past this hour.</i>

934
01:48:45,567 --> 01:48:48,609
<i>All troops are to return to their station.</i>

935
01:48:49,484 --> 01:48:50,525
What time is it?

936
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:58,400
-Why aren't you asleep?
-Listen a minute.

937
01:49:01,984 --> 01:49:03,109
It's so still.

938
01:49:05,650 --> 01:49:07,025
I must be going deaf.

939
01:49:13,400 --> 01:49:14,775
They've signed, Paul.

940
01:49:19,525 --> 01:49:20,567
The war's over.

941
01:49:22,525 --> 01:49:23,484
It's over.

942
01:49:29,234 --> 01:49:30,234
Are you hungry?

943
01:49:31,192 --> 01:49:32,359
I'm hungry.

944
01:49:37,359 --> 01:49:38,775
Where are you going?

945
01:49:38,859 --> 01:49:40,984
Come on,
before the bastard wakes up.

946
01:49:43,109 --> 01:49:46,192
-What are you doing for Christmas, Paul?
-I don't know.

947
01:49:46,275 --> 01:49:48,025
I'm gonna roast a goose.

948
01:49:48,609 --> 01:49:50,317
Red cabbage, potatoes…

949
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:53,025
Then I'll light all the candles
and kiss my wife.

950
01:49:53,109 --> 01:49:55,734
My God, Paul, she is beautiful.

951
01:49:55,817 --> 01:49:56,859
Yeah?

952
01:49:56,942 --> 01:49:59,234
-What does she look like?
-Well…

953
01:49:59,817 --> 01:50:02,150
Long curly hair, dark.

954
01:50:02,817 --> 01:50:05,067
And she's buxom and strong.

955
01:50:05,150 --> 01:50:05,984
Yeah?

956
01:50:08,484 --> 01:50:09,400
Christmas.

957
01:50:10,234 --> 01:50:11,609
It's all so far away still.

958
01:50:12,150 --> 01:50:13,900
No, it's not. It's really close.

959
01:50:17,734 --> 01:50:20,567
We want another child. Or children, Paul.

960
01:50:20,650 --> 01:50:24,109
Because what is Christmas
without children? It's nothing, really.

961
01:50:24,192 --> 01:50:25,025
Ah?

962
01:50:26,859 --> 01:50:27,859
You know when…

963
01:50:28,650 --> 01:50:30,400
Once we're back home, then we will…

964
01:50:31,109 --> 01:50:32,984
-Yeah?
-We must do something together.

965
01:50:33,734 --> 01:50:35,775
The two of us together.
Something big, yeah?

966
01:50:35,859 --> 01:50:36,692
Yeah, yeah.

967
01:50:38,775 --> 01:50:39,650
What is it?

968
01:50:40,317 --> 01:50:42,984
I'm a shoemaker, Paul. I repair shoes.

969
01:50:43,525 --> 01:50:47,067
Ah? You know how to read, write.
You finished school.

970
01:50:48,067 --> 01:50:49,317
Hasn't done me any good, though.

971
01:50:50,525 --> 01:50:51,609
What are we gonna do?

972
01:50:52,317 --> 01:50:53,734
Sole shoes together?

973
01:50:54,484 --> 01:50:55,775
Are you trying to insult me?

974
01:50:57,109 --> 01:50:58,817
I can't read my wife's letters even now.

975
01:51:00,192 --> 01:51:01,484
You're going to university, Paul.

976
01:51:02,525 --> 01:51:03,859
Or I'll shoot you right here.

977
01:51:06,317 --> 01:51:07,442
My trousers are loose.

978
01:51:10,317 --> 01:51:11,525
My trousers are loose.

979
01:51:13,984 --> 01:51:15,859
You'll just have to eat something.

980
01:51:16,775 --> 01:51:18,984
Soon we'll be home
then we can eat whatever we want.

981
01:51:20,275 --> 01:51:21,150
Whatever we want.

982
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:47,400
It's your go.

983
01:51:48,067 --> 01:51:50,067
If the farmer catches me again,

984
01:51:50,150 --> 01:51:52,025
then he's bound
to shoot me down where I stand.

985
01:51:56,442 --> 01:51:58,275
Just be careful of the damn dog too.

986
01:51:58,359 --> 01:51:59,234
Yeah.

987
01:52:31,275 --> 01:52:32,275
Ah?

988
01:52:50,692 --> 01:52:52,775
Shh, shh… Hey, hey, hey.

989
01:53:13,192 --> 01:53:14,150
Look.

990
01:53:17,192 --> 01:53:18,525
It's really good.

991
01:53:21,900 --> 01:53:22,734
Want some?

992
01:53:25,234 --> 01:53:26,150
Shit.

993
01:54:08,984 --> 01:54:10,984
Piece of garbage…

994
01:54:17,192 --> 01:54:18,192
Stop!

995
01:54:19,150 --> 01:54:20,275
Thief!

996
01:54:28,859 --> 01:54:30,484
Kat! Run!

997
01:54:31,359 --> 01:54:32,359
Run!

998
01:54:34,234 --> 01:54:35,234
Asshole!

999
01:54:40,942 --> 01:54:41,775
God damn!

1000
01:54:43,025 --> 01:54:45,025
We'll kill them, these sons of bitches.

1001
01:55:02,275 --> 01:55:03,650
Oh, crap.

1002
01:55:03,734 --> 01:55:05,150
-Look at this.
-What is it?

1003
01:55:06,109 --> 01:55:08,067
-A lucky shot.
-He hit the eggs!

1004
01:55:09,942 --> 01:55:11,025
Stop the flow.

1005
01:55:16,484 --> 01:55:17,775
Come on, get it in there.

1006
01:55:18,859 --> 01:55:19,900
There you go.

1007
01:55:22,859 --> 01:55:24,192
We can have an omelette.

1008
01:55:24,275 --> 01:55:26,400
No, we'll eat them now.

1009
01:55:26,484 --> 01:55:27,400
They're just as good.

1010
01:55:46,317 --> 01:55:47,400
Better than ever.

1011
01:55:49,192 --> 01:55:50,109
I won't be long.

1012
01:57:27,484 --> 01:57:28,400
Kat?

1013
01:57:33,317 --> 01:57:34,484
Kat?

1014
01:57:38,859 --> 01:57:39,734
Kat!

1015
01:57:41,942 --> 01:57:42,984
What happened?

1016
01:57:43,900 --> 01:57:44,734
We should leave.

1017
01:57:46,609 --> 01:57:47,650
Who fired the shot?

1018
01:57:48,150 --> 01:57:49,525
That little shit from the farm.

1019
01:57:50,650 --> 01:57:51,817
The farmer's son.

1020
01:57:53,859 --> 01:57:55,275
Kat, Kat.

1021
01:57:56,150 --> 01:57:57,192
What a mess.

1022
01:58:05,317 --> 01:58:06,192
How big is it?

1023
01:58:06,692 --> 01:58:08,984
Little finger.
I'll get the bullet out.

1024
01:58:09,067 --> 01:58:11,317
No. Give me a cigarette.

1025
01:58:12,525 --> 01:58:13,692
Let the medic do that.

1026
01:58:32,109 --> 01:58:34,192
They stuck me in a class
with seven-year-olds.

1027
01:58:36,109 --> 01:58:37,734
I'd begun shaving already.

1028
01:58:39,442 --> 01:58:40,525
Find me a word.

1029
01:58:42,650 --> 01:58:44,192
That trifle can rhyme with.

1030
01:58:45,359 --> 01:58:46,192
Mhm.

1031
01:58:48,275 --> 01:58:50,567
Nothing rhymes with trifle. Nothing.

1032
01:58:57,150 --> 01:58:58,525
Fucking shit.

1033
01:58:59,942 --> 01:59:02,067
Why the hell did this have to happen now?

1034
01:59:05,900 --> 01:59:07,525
-Come on, we need to move.
-Yeah.

1035
01:59:14,692 --> 01:59:15,609
Alright?

1036
01:59:16,650 --> 01:59:17,859
Kat?

1037
01:59:17,942 --> 01:59:19,067
Rifle.

1038
01:59:19,150 --> 01:59:20,317
Mhm?

1039
01:59:20,400 --> 01:59:22,109
Rifle rhymes with trifle.

1040
01:59:32,067 --> 01:59:35,775
When we get home, you're going
to make a new pair of boots for me.

1041
01:59:35,859 --> 01:59:37,692
I'm walking my feet to the bone.

1042
01:59:52,275 --> 01:59:53,150
Hey!

1043
01:59:56,609 --> 01:59:57,734
Wait!

1044
01:59:59,317 --> 02:00:00,275
Pull over!

1045
02:00:00,859 --> 02:00:01,734
Let us on!

1046
02:00:02,900 --> 02:00:04,525
Hey! Let us on!

1047
02:00:15,650 --> 02:00:16,734
Come on, will you?

1048
02:00:52,234 --> 02:00:53,359
This man needs care.

1049
02:00:55,734 --> 02:00:56,900
Where is the medic?

1050
02:01:25,984 --> 02:01:27,692
Could've spared yourself
the trouble.

1051
02:01:28,859 --> 02:01:29,692
Huh?

1052
02:01:30,734 --> 02:01:31,567
He's dead.

1053
02:01:37,150 --> 02:01:39,525
But it's… It's just a small bullet wound.

1054
02:01:40,150 --> 02:01:42,817
Yes, black blood. Straight into the liver.

1055
02:01:43,359 --> 02:01:44,442
The organs are poisoned.

1056
02:01:51,400 --> 02:01:52,400
Unconscious.

1057
02:01:53,525 --> 02:01:54,359
No.

1058
02:01:54,984 --> 02:01:55,942
He's dead.

1059
02:01:56,484 --> 02:01:57,609
I know what I'm doing.

1060
02:01:59,984 --> 02:02:02,775
Impossible. I was…
I was just talking to him.

1061
02:02:03,359 --> 02:02:04,484
He's unconscious.

1062
02:02:06,359 --> 02:02:07,442
He's unconscious.

1063
02:02:14,859 --> 02:02:15,692
See?

1064
02:02:17,609 --> 02:02:20,400
He simply had bad luck.
Right before the end.

1065
02:04:09,109 --> 02:04:10,734
Go on, keep going!

1066
02:04:10,817 --> 02:04:12,192
Keep going!

1067
02:04:12,692 --> 02:04:14,317
Keep going, come on!

1068
02:04:22,984 --> 02:04:24,067
This is it.

1069
02:04:26,234 --> 02:04:27,734
I'm going to tell him I'm going home.

1070
02:04:29,692 --> 02:04:30,692
It's over.

1071
02:04:32,525 --> 02:04:34,192
Attention!

1072
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:41,359
Soldiers.

1073
02:04:41,984 --> 02:04:44,150
We stand here as brothers

1074
02:04:45,109 --> 02:04:46,817
in a world of enemies

1075
02:04:46,900 --> 02:04:49,817
and are forced to watch
as German social democrats

1076
02:04:49,900 --> 02:04:52,859
render our beloved people defenseless

1077
02:04:54,150 --> 02:04:57,067
by accepting a perfidious armistice.

1078
02:04:59,109 --> 02:05:00,025
Comrades.

1079
02:05:01,067 --> 02:05:02,900
Soon you will be going home

1080
02:05:02,984 --> 02:05:05,400
to your parents, wives and children.

1081
02:05:06,359 --> 02:05:07,525
The war is over.

1082
02:05:08,234 --> 02:05:13,067
After years of sacrifice and suffering,
you can now look forward to your reward.

1083
02:05:13,734 --> 02:05:17,900
To the reward of admiration
for all you have achieved here.

1084
02:05:19,400 --> 02:05:20,984
Ah, but comrades,

1085
02:05:22,400 --> 02:05:25,234
do you want to be welcomed
as soldiers and heroes on your return

1086
02:05:27,275 --> 02:05:28,150
or as weaklings

1087
02:05:28,234 --> 02:05:31,400
and cowards who tucked their tails in
when it really counted?

1088
02:05:31,484 --> 02:05:32,525
We're going home.

1089
02:05:32,609 --> 02:05:33,484
Soldiers.

1090
02:05:34,317 --> 02:05:38,234
We are about to attack them
with the utmost force and vehemence.

1091
02:05:38,942 --> 02:05:42,484
Latierre belongs in German hands.

1092
02:05:42,567 --> 02:05:47,525
We will seize the plains before 11:00 a.m.
and end this war with a merciless strike.

1093
02:05:47,609 --> 02:05:48,942
and make them see…

1094
02:05:49,984 --> 02:05:51,484
…we were victorious.

1095
02:05:51,567 --> 02:05:56,567
Onwards, with God on our side
as he was with our fathers before us.

1096
02:05:56,650 --> 02:05:59,317
I'm not going back
into battle. Not me!

1097
02:05:59,400 --> 02:06:00,567
Shut up!

1098
02:06:01,859 --> 02:06:04,317
-Let me go!
-Follow your orders!

1099
02:06:04,400 --> 02:06:06,192
Do as your told!

1100
02:06:06,275 --> 02:06:07,359
All of you, get back.

1101
02:06:08,067 --> 02:06:10,442
-Please, I didn't do anything!
-Aim!

1102
02:06:10,525 --> 02:06:13,275
-No! No!
-Fire!

1103
02:06:37,567 --> 02:06:38,775
Keep moving!

1104
02:06:41,650 --> 02:06:42,484
Come on!

1105
02:06:50,734 --> 02:06:52,650
Company, halt!

1106
02:06:56,942 --> 02:06:59,109
Rifle off!

1107
02:06:59,192 --> 02:07:02,359
-Fix bayonets!
-Fix bayonets and load!

1108
02:07:17,400 --> 02:07:18,859
What time is it?

1109
02:07:18,942 --> 02:07:20,275
Fifteen minutes to go.

1110
02:07:57,609 --> 02:07:58,984
It belonged to Lefevre.

1111
02:08:00,275 --> 02:08:02,067
Poor bastard, he saved it for the end.

1112
02:08:02,775 --> 02:08:05,067
-He won't need it anymore.
-Thank you, sir.

1113
02:08:09,359 --> 02:08:11,192
Here's to you and to Lefevre.

1114
02:08:17,525 --> 02:08:18,567
Well, it's good.

1115
02:08:22,192 --> 02:08:23,192
The nightmare is over.

1116
02:09:23,359 --> 02:09:26,317
Enemy attack! Enemy attack!

1117
02:09:26,400 --> 02:09:28,067
-In position!
-In position!

1118
02:09:30,650 --> 02:09:32,067
Fire!

1119
02:09:32,942 --> 02:09:34,150
Fire!

1120
02:10:09,359 --> 02:10:11,067
Throw the grenades!

1121
02:10:21,775 --> 02:10:22,942
Charge!

1122
02:11:19,192 --> 02:11:21,109
Please, no! No, no!

1123
02:13:11,609 --> 02:13:13,317
Cease fire!

1124
02:13:13,400 --> 02:13:14,942
It is 11:00 a.m.!

1125
02:13:15,609 --> 02:13:17,025
Cease fire!

1126
02:13:17,525 --> 02:13:19,525
Cease fire!

1127
02:13:20,525 --> 02:13:22,609
It is eleven o'clock.

1128
02:15:57,692 --> 02:16:00,567
A light!
Bring me a light! A light please!

1129
02:16:19,859 --> 02:16:21,442
Are you alright?

1130
02:16:22,859 --> 02:16:23,817
Yeah.

1131
02:16:24,650 --> 02:16:27,109
Well, then.
Start gathering, please.

1132
02:19:48,442 --> 02:19:52,025
Shortly after the start of hostilities
in October 1914,

1133
02:19:52,109 --> 02:19:54,942
the Western Front
froze into positional warfare.

1134
02:19:56,442 --> 02:20:02,734
By the end of the war in November 1918,
the front line had barely moved.

1135
02:20:04,400 --> 02:20:07,109
More than three million soldiers
died here,

1136
02:20:07,192 --> 02:20:10,775
often while fighting to gain
only a few hundred meters of ground.

1137
02:20:12,359 --> 02:20:18,692
Almost 17 million people
lost their lives in the First World War.

1138
02:20:20,859 --> 02:20:27,400
ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT
