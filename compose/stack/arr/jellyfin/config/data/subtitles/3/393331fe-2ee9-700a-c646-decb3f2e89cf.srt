31
00:55:24,333 --> 00:55:25,917

Weygand,
what do these gentlemen want?

35
01:05:25,167 --> 01:05:26,667
I don't know.

36
01:06:05,708 --> 01:06:09,375
If you please,
we would like to know the conditions--

37
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:38,042
[in French] We are asking
for an armistice.

38
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:45,792
You have 72 hours
to accept our conditions.

39
01:07:07,958 --> 01:07:08,958
Sign then.

40
01:22:07,917 --> 01:22:10,250
Retreat! Retreat!

41
01:27:13,625 --> 01:27:14,542
So sorry.

42
01:27:15,958 --> 01:27:17,042
So sorry.

43
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,208
I am so sorry. I am so sorry.

THE KAISER HAS ABDICATED

50
01:44:17,208 --> 01:44:18,125
Henri.

51
01:44:21,708 --> 01:44:22,833
Taste it.

52
01:44:26,833 --> 01:44:27,917
Were they made today?

53
01:44:30,917 --> 01:44:32,875
I'm sorry, sir. I don't think so.

54
01:45:05,875 --> 01:45:07,000
I'm listening.

55
01:45:25,833 --> 01:45:29,042
This is a disease
of the defeated, not of the victorious.

56
01:45:29,208 --> 01:45:30,500
I don't fear it.

57
01:45:30,667 --> 01:45:32,208
I reject any compromise.

58
01:45:40,583 --> 01:45:41,542
Fair?

59
01:45:44,875 --> 01:45:46,458
You speak of fairness?

60
01:46:00,625 --> 01:46:01,750
Sign it.

61
01:47:19,375 --> 01:47:20,667
Very good.

62
01:47:21,292 --> 01:47:22,417
The war is over.

63
01:53:13,208 --> 01:53:14,167
Look.

64
01:53:17,208 --> 01:53:18,542
It's really good.

65
01:53:21,917 --> 01:53:22,750
Want some?

66
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Piece of garbage...

67
01:54:17,208 --> 01:54:18,208
Stop!

68
01:54:19,167 --> 01:54:20,292
Thief!

69
01:54:34,250 --> 01:54:35,250
Asshole!

70
01:54:40,958 --> 01:54:41,792
God damn!

71
01:54:43,042 --> 01:54:45,042
Wel'll kill them, these sons of bitches.

72
02:07:57,625 --> 02:07:59,000
It belonged to Lefevre.

73
02:08:00,292 --> 02:08:02,083
Poor bastard, he saved it for the end.

74
02:08:02,792 --> 02:08:05,083
-He won't need it anymore.
-Thank you, sir.

75
02:08:09,375 --> 02:08:11,208
Here's to you and to Lefevre.

76
02:08:17,542 --> 02:08:18,583
Well, it's good.

77
02:08:22,208 --> 02:08:23,208
The nightmare is over.

78
02:09:23,375 --> 02:09:26,333
Enemy attack! Enemy attack!

79
02:09:26,500 --> 02:09:28,083
-In position!
-In position!

80
02:09:30,667 --> 02:09:32,083
Fire!

81
02:09:32,958 --> 02:09:34,167
Fire!

82
02:10:21,792 --> 02:10:22,958
Charge!

83
02:13:11,625 --> 02:13:13,333
Cease fire!

84
02:13:13,500 --> 02:13:14,958
Itis 11:00 a.m.!

85
02:15:57,708 --> 02:16:00,583
A light!
Bring me a light! A light please!

86
02:19:48,458 --> 02:19:52,042
Shortly after the start of hostilities
in October 1914,

87
02:19:52,208 --> 02:19:54,958
the Western Front
froze into positional warfare.

88
02:19:56,458 --> 02:20:02,750
By the end of the war in November 1918,
the front line had barely moved.

89
02:20:04,417 --> 02:20:07,125
More than three million soldiers
died here,

90
02:20:07,292 --> 02:20:10,792
often while fighting to gain
only a few hundred meters of ground.

91
02:20:12,375 --> 02:20:18,708
Almost 17 million people
lost their lives in the First World War.
