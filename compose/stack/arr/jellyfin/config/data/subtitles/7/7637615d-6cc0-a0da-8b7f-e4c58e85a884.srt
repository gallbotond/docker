[Paul] Mhm.

62
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,359
-Well then?
-I don't know.

63
00:08:50,442 --> 00:08:52,359
-Does he know we're all going?
-Yes, of course.

64
00:08:52,442 --> 00:08:53,442
Staying at home?

65
00:08:53,525 --> 00:08:55,900
My God, you're tied
to your mother's apron strings, my friend.

66
00:08:57,692 --> 00:08:59,275
Give me it, I'll scribble something.

67
00:08:59,359 --> 00:09:02,275
-It has to be signed by his parents.
-Well, someone. Come on, pass it here.

Well?

70
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,859

Ludwig.

75
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:18,109
You mustn't. Your father will hit you.

76
00:09:18,192 --> 00:09:21,109
Have you got a better idea?
I'm not being left behind here.

[boy 1] Congratulations, Private Baumer.
We're going to the front.

[drum beats sound]

83
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:46,442
[principal] You stand here
on the threshold of existence.

84
00:09:46,525 --> 00:09:47,609
[drum beats sound]

85
00:09:47,692 --> 00:09:49,359
[principal] Remember this moment.

86
00:09:49,442 --> 00:09:51,192
[drum beats sound]

87
00:09:51,275 --> 00:09:52,775
[principal] It is a great moment.

88
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:57,984
For in years to come, you will be judged
based on what you dared to become today.

89
00:09:58,609 --> 00:10:00,859
The iron youth of Germany.

90
00:10:01,775 --> 00:10:02,859
My friends,

91
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,150
we are fortunate
to be alive at a great time.

92
00:10:06,234 --> 00:10:08,692
Your deeds will be the water

93
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,775
nourishing the growth
of a strong and noble route.

94
00:10:11,859 --> 00:10:13,984
Stand still and listen up, Leinemann!

95
00:10:14,775 --> 00:10:16,942
The Kaiser needs soldiers, not children.

96
00:10:18,984 --> 00:10:23,442
I am certain that I will see
most of you again soon, here at home.

97
00:10:24,442 --> 00:10:27,734
Your sword returned to its scabbard
with honour and respect.

98
00:10:28,859 --> 00:10:32,525
A cross crafted from iron
proudly displayed upon your chest.

99
00:10:33,192 --> 00:10:34,775
However, take heed of this.

100
00:10:35,984 --> 00:10:39,442
In the darkest of hours,
let me assure you it will happen,

101
00:10:39,984 --> 00:10:43,192
that prior to an attack,
you will harbour doubts.

102
00:10:43,692 --> 00:10:46,650
But this is not the time
to concede to any mental weakness.

103
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:51,859
Any unsteadiness, any hesitation
is a betrayal of the fatherland!

104
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:54,817
For modern war is like a game of chess.

105
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,400
It is never about an individual soldier.

106
00:10:57,484 --> 00:10:59,817
Our only care
is for the entirety of the body.

107
00:11:01,484 --> 00:11:04,525
You have the chance to earn the right
to wear the uniforms you have been given.

108
00:11:05,275 --> 00:11:08,609
And by going to the front line
in Flanders, we'll pierce the enemy.

109
00:11:08,692 --> 00:11:12,400
And then you will, in a few short weeks,

110
00:11:12,484 --> 00:11:15,109
finally march on Paris!

111
00:11:15,192 --> 00:11:16,650
Yeah!

112
00:11:16,734 --> 00:11:18,025
[principal] Our future,

113
00:11:18,692 --> 00:11:20,317
the future of <i>Deutschland</i>,

114
00:11:21,442 --> 00:11:24,109
lies in the hands
of its greatest generation.

115
00:11:25,359 --> 00:11:27,817
My friends, that is you, you see!

116
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,859
Yeah!

117
00:11:28,942 --> 00:11:30,900
Therefore, off to the camps

118
00:11:30,984 --> 00:11:34,650
for the Kaiser, God, and the fatherland!

119
00:11:34,734 --> 00:11:36,234
Yeah!

00:11:36,317 --> 00:11:38,400

126
00:11:59,525 --> 00:12:02,692
Born November 18th, 1899. Correct?

127
00:12:02,775 --> 00:12:03,650
<i>Jawohl</i>, sir.

128
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,275

132
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:16,275
Here. Your father can be proud of you.

133
00:12:16,359 --> 00:12:17,192
Yes.

134
00:12:19,984 --> 00:12:21,109
Is everything alright?

135
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:23,692
Yes. I'm eager to get on with it.

136
00:12:24,609 --> 00:12:25,442
Move along.

137
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:27,567
Here he comes.

-[recruiter 1]Name and address.

139
00:12:30,442 --> 00:12:31,817
-And the next.
-[Paul] Excuse me.

140
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,525
It already belongs to someone.

141
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:39,067
Ah, yes. It was probably too small
for the fellow. Happens all the time.

142
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,775
Here. It's yours.

143
00:12:41,442 --> 00:12:42,567
Thank you.

[boy] I remember it, you were. [laughs]

148
00:13:03,025 --> 00:13:05,817
Oh, Ludwig, will you be snatching away
all the ladies from us now?

149
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,984
Yeah. [laughs]

150
00:13:07,067 --> 00:13:08,984
My concern is that you don't shoot us.

She won't do it.

-[lieutenant, in English] Your name?
-Kropp. Albert Kropp, sir.

168
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,400
[lieutenant] Do you like dirty girls,
Kropp?

169
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,567
Do you like dirty girls?

170
00:14:40,025 --> 00:14:42,025
Uh, no. I don't, sir.

171
00:14:42,109 --> 00:14:44,109
[lieutenant] So why
do you sleep with one then?

172

Report for guard duty at three o'clock.

173
00:14:47,859 --> 00:14:50,817
Gentlemen, you'll be fighting
in a godforsaken shithole.

174
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:54,817
And you'll kindly do so with a clean G98.

00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,442
You will pamper it.

176
00:14:56,525 --> 00:14:57,984
You will love it.

177
00:14:58,067 --> 00:15:00,192

you will keep it as immaculate

00:15:05,984 --> 00:15:08,859
Welcome
to the 78th Reserve Infantry Regiment.

182
00:15:10,525 --> 00:15:12,067
We are now on the Western Front.

183
00:15:13,317 --> 00:15:15,650
-Welcome to Paris!
-Yeah! Welcome to Paris!

184
00:15:21,275 --> 00:15:22,109
[engine sounds]

185
00:15:22,192 --> 00:15:23,025
[medic] Ah!

186
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:26,942
Down there! Down there!

187
00:15:30,734 --> 00:15:32,609
Down there! This way!

188
00:15:36,609 --> 00:15:37,817
-[horn honks]
-[medic] This way!

189
00:15:44,775 --> 00:15:47,817
-[soldier] Go on! Over there on the right!
-[lieutenant] Damn it, what happened?

190
00:15:48,692 --> 00:15:51,275
I have orders to hand over the company
to the front by 6:00 p.m.

191
00:15:51,359 --> 00:15:52,859
That you may, but on foot.

192
00:15:53,359 --> 00:15:54,900
You must give us the trucks, lieutenant.

193
00:15:54,984 --> 00:15:56,442
With all due respect, I have orders--

194
00:15:56,525 --> 00:15:58,484
Take the orders
and stick them up your arse.

195
00:15:58,567 --> 00:16:00,567
I have 40 men here
who are dying in the mud.

196
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:01,859
Get out right now, will you?

197
00:16:03,442 --> 00:16:04,567
[horse neighs]

198
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:05,984
[lieutenant] Everyone, get up.

199
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,275
Come on, get on with it.

200
00:16:10,359 --> 00:16:12,109
You heard the staff surgeon.

201
00:16:12,817 --> 00:16:14,150
[heavy breathing]

202
00:16:14,234 --> 00:16:17,150
Faster, soldiers. Don't fall asleep here.

203
00:16:20,567 --> 00:16:21,692
Keep moving.

204
00:16:27,984 --> 00:16:29,525
-Franz Muller, correct?
-Yes.

205
00:16:30,067 --> 00:16:31,109
The supreme army command

206
00:16:31,192 --> 00:16:33,900
expects you to survive
at least six weeks of being here.

207
00:16:33,984 --> 00:16:35,984
Would you like that,
in six weeks, to still be alive?

208
00:16:36,067 --> 00:16:37,359
-<i>Jawohl</i>, sir.
-Then walk quicker

209
00:16:37,442 --> 00:16:39,525
and stop dragging your feet
like you would do at home.

210
00:16:40,442 --> 00:16:41,942
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

211
00:16:42,984 --> 00:16:44,109
[lieutenant] Hurry up.

212
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,692
We're not at a tea party here.

213
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,692
-[explosion sounds]
-[shouting]

214
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,109
[lieutenant] Gas!

215
00:16:55,609 --> 00:16:57,942
-Gas!
-[soldiers] Gas!

216
00:16:58,025 --> 00:16:59,650
[lieutenant] Gas!

217
00:16:59,734 --> 00:17:00,942
[soldiers] Gas!

218
00:17:02,234 --> 00:17:03,817
[soldier] Gas masks on!

219
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,442
That, gentlemen, was a fat pig.

220
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,859
If the French could aim better,

221
00:17:08,942 --> 00:17:13,275
you could scrape us all off the road
with a spoon and bury us in a saucepan.

222
00:17:13,817 --> 00:17:17,234
But one thing
that's as certain as amen in church.

223
00:17:18,234 --> 00:17:21,067
Fat pigs don't carry gas.

224
00:17:21,942 --> 00:17:24,109
-[horse neighs]
-[lieutenant] Eyes straight ahead.

225
00:17:28,525 --> 00:17:30,692
[heavy breathing]

226
00:17:30,775 --> 00:17:32,317
[horse neighs]

227
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:40,650
-Are you deaf?
-[Paul] No, sir.

228
00:17:41,275 --> 00:17:43,442
I was just trying to put my mask on.

229
00:17:51,025 --> 00:17:54,484
Paul Baumer,
you will almost certainly be dead by dawn.

230
00:17:54,567 --> 00:17:55,400
[thunder rumbles]

231
00:17:55,484 --> 00:17:57,025
You should eat something, man.

232
00:17:58,817 --> 00:18:01,359
Attention! Gas masks off!

233
00:18:01,442 --> 00:18:03,317
[soldier] Gas masks off!

234
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,484
[lieutenant] Not you.

235
00:18:04,567 --> 00:18:07,025
You keep yours on
until guard duty tonight.

236
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:09,692
Both you and that useless pig.

237
00:18:10,484 --> 00:18:12,567
Fall in line. March.

238
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:13,859
[soldier] Fall in line!

239
00:18:13,942 --> 00:18:16,359
Stay together and keep moving!

240
00:18:16,442 --> 00:18:17,275
[heavy breathing]

241
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:19,150
[lieutenant] Come on, hurry up!

242
00:18:19,234 --> 00:18:20,067
[soldier] Go!

243
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:22,150
[thunder rumbles]

244
00:18:25,275 --> 00:18:27,275
[gunfire sounds]

245
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,942
[explosions sound]

246
00:18:37,025 --> 00:18:40,150
Come on. Paul, come on.
Give me your knapsack.

247
00:18:40,234 --> 00:18:41,984
Next time, you carry mine.

248
00:18:50,734 --> 00:18:52,734
[heavy breathing]

249
00:18:54,484 --> 00:18:56,234
[lieutenant] Congratulations, soldiers.

250
00:18:56,317 --> 00:18:58,150
This is your home now.

251
00:18:58,234 --> 00:18:59,234
Helmets off.

252
00:19:00,609 --> 00:19:03,525
I see the men have been enjoying
themselves in my absence, Steinberger.

253
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,400
We were under barrage all night.

254
00:19:05,484 --> 00:19:06,567
The men are a mess.

255
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,650
I think dry boots
would be a good place to begin.

256
00:19:09,192 --> 00:19:10,775
Oh, you'd rather we all drown then?

257
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:13,817
Everyone pitch in!
Come on, bail out the trench.

258
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,359
[Steinberger] Get in line
to bail the water!

259
00:19:19,442 --> 00:19:21,192
What are you waiting for, Baumer?

260
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:26,067
Why are you still loitering here?
Go and help bail out the trenches.

261
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,650
Throw a dog a piece of meat.

262
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:29,275
[lieutenant] Come on, all of you!

263
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:30,942
It will always snap it up.

264
00:19:32,484 --> 00:19:33,859
Give a man powerâ€¦

265
00:19:37,942 --> 00:19:39,317
Man is a beast.

266
00:19:40,567 --> 00:19:41,442
Drink.

267
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:48,359
[Steinberger] Katczinsky, come over here.
Give us a hand.

268
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,109
Tonight, it'll be even worse.

269
00:20:03,109 --> 00:20:05,109
[gunfire and explosions continue]

270
00:20:20,775 --> 00:20:23,234
[grunting]

271
00:20:25,109 --> 00:20:26,025
Sorry.

272
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:27,859
Forget it.

273
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,442
Somehow, this isn't how I imagined it.

274
00:20:31,525 --> 00:20:32,525
Just shut up, Ludwig.

275
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:36,359
My hands. I can't feel my hands any more.

276
00:20:44,275 --> 00:20:45,734
Stick them down your underwear.

277
00:20:46,275 --> 00:20:47,442
It always works for me.

278
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:53,859
[sombre music playing]

279
00:21:27,609 --> 00:21:29,525
[Albert] That will make it shoot better,
will it?

280
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:38,400
[laughs]

281
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,734
-[Paul] Did you hear that?
-[Albert] Hear what?

282
00:21:47,234 --> 00:21:48,692
[Paul] That sound. Listen.

283
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:50,025
[Albert] There's nothing there.

284
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:51,942
[Paul shushes]

285
00:22:00,484 --> 00:22:02,275
Our first French to shoot.

286
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:04,275
Calm down, Paulchen. [laughs]

287
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:10,650
There's someone out there.

288
00:22:21,775 --> 00:22:22,775
[whispering] Who's there?

289
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:25,234
Hey.

290
00:22:27,859 --> 00:22:28,859
[in French] Show yourself!

291
00:22:35,525 --> 00:22:36,692
[gunshots]

292
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,317
[metal clangs]

293
00:22:47,192 --> 00:22:48,400
[in English] Oh, no, no, no!

294
00:22:48,484 --> 00:22:51,317
I'm hit! I'm hit! I've been hit! Get off!

295
00:22:52,192 --> 00:22:54,359
-[Albert] No, Paul. No.
-[soldier] What's going on?

296
00:22:54,442 --> 00:22:55,525
[Albert] You're fine.

297
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:57,859
[groans]

298
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,734
What is it?

299
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,317
The others, over there. They shot at me.

300
00:23:12,317 --> 00:23:13,859
They saw the flash of your muzzle.

301
00:23:15,234 --> 00:23:16,192
Huh?

302
00:23:16,275 --> 00:23:17,775
From now on, keep your heads down.

303
00:23:17,859 --> 00:23:20,109
If you don't want to catch
the next bullet with your teeth,

304
00:23:20,192 --> 00:23:21,275
move ten meters to the left.

305
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:24,109
Shoot, change cover.
Shoot, change cover. Understand?

306
00:23:25,859 --> 00:23:26,692
Yeah.

307
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:33,567
[grunts]

308
00:23:41,775 --> 00:23:43,275
Come on. Paul.

309
00:23:45,775 --> 00:23:47,775
[sombre violin music playing]

310
00:23:51,192 --> 00:23:52,275
[explosion sounds]

311
00:24:33,275 --> 00:24:36,067
[soldier] Take cover! Take cover! Alarm!

312
00:24:37,734 --> 00:24:38,942
[shouting]

313
00:24:39,025 --> 00:24:40,067
[soldier] Here!

314
00:24:40,775 --> 00:24:43,317
Baumer, come here. Quickly, come on.

315
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:44,900
Into the bunker!

316
00:24:48,609 --> 00:24:50,859
Inside! Inside! Inside!

317
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:05,025
[explosions continue]

318
00:25:09,192 --> 00:25:10,442
"Be careful what you eat."

319
00:25:11,317 --> 00:25:13,984
That's what my mother said. [laughs]

320
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,109
-We'll always be together, won't we?
-Yeah.

321
00:25:18,192 --> 00:25:19,775
We'll stick together. We'll always be.

322
00:25:21,692 --> 00:25:25,150
I can't do this, Paul.
I can't do this. I need to go home.

323
00:25:25,234 --> 00:25:26,442
-[shushes]
-I need to go home.

324
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:35,192
[coughing]

325
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,192
Creeping barrage.

326
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:53,192
What?

327
00:25:54,442 --> 00:25:55,400
Every couple of minutes,

328
00:25:55,484 --> 00:25:57,400
the artillery barrage
makes an advance forward.

329
00:25:58,609 --> 00:25:59,900
And directly after that,

330
00:26:00,942 --> 00:26:02,567
the infantry moves forward.

331
00:26:04,234 --> 00:26:05,442
What are you saying, exactly?

332
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,234
That's how they come.

333
00:26:18,775 --> 00:26:19,692
[explosion sounds]

334
00:26:19,775 --> 00:26:21,442
[shouting]

335
00:26:21,525 --> 00:26:23,525
[heavy breathing]

336
00:26:28,275 --> 00:26:29,275
Where are you going?

337
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:30,317
I'll come back.

338
00:26:31,067 --> 00:26:32,109
It's nearly over.

339
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:36,025
-No! Let me go.
-Stay where you are.

340
00:26:36,109 --> 00:26:38,609
-Let me out of here. I want to get out.
-Calm down.

341
00:26:39,984 --> 00:26:41,067
Calm yourself.

342
00:26:45,567 --> 00:26:46,442
No!

343
00:26:47,775 --> 00:26:49,609
[screaming]

344
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:53,192
Get out! Out! Out! Out!

345
00:26:53,984 --> 00:26:54,859
Out!

346
00:27:11,234 --> 00:27:13,234
[silence]

347
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,900
[sombre music playing]

348
00:27:28,317 --> 00:27:30,609
[heavy breathing]

349
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:32,692
[muted gunshots and explosions sound]

350
00:27:55,817 --> 00:27:57,775
[Franz muffled] Hey, that's Paul!

351
00:27:57,859 --> 00:27:58,734
Albert!

352
00:27:58,817 --> 00:28:00,650
Come here, we found Paul!

353
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,317
[Albert] Paul!

354
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:13,692
Are you alright?

355
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,317
Is everything alright, Paul?

356
00:28:16,942 --> 00:28:18,567
[Franz] Come on. Paul, come on.

357
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:19,817
I'll help you.

358
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,442
Come on. Get up, will you? Sit down.

359
00:28:22,525 --> 00:28:23,609

We need help!

368
00:28:53,692 --> 00:28:54,525
Steady.

369

Steady.

370
00:29:01,692 --> 00:29:02,525
That's it.

371
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:05,525
I've got you.

372
00:29:07,817 --> 00:29:09,025

[lieutenant] Come on! Keep working!

394
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:06,775

God be with us.

413

Once more, over 40,000 killed
in the last few weeks alone.

414
00:35:54,275 --> 00:35:56,234
That should convince the general staff.

415
00:35:57,775 --> 00:35:59,900
I think the gentlemen know it's over.

416
00:36:02,484 --> 00:36:03,567

Explain to me
how this is worth dying for in your mind.

436
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,984
When you're starving, you'll do anything.

"Tjaden, go back home
and ask again, will you?"

502
00:41:30,567 --> 00:41:33,859
Next morning, Tjaden springs into school
and says to everybody,

00:41:33,942 --> 00:41:37,150
"Please forgive me."
"My father wasn't the leader of Nazareth."

[Albert] I wouldn't put trousers on
for eight days.

539
00:43:55,609 --> 00:43:58,817
I should really be spanking your backside
for talking about something like that.

540
00:43:58,900 --> 00:43:59,984
What about you, Paul?

541
00:44:01,442 --> 00:44:04,650
-No idea. Can't think.
-[Tjaden] I'd stay with the Prussians.

542
00:44:05,192 --> 00:44:06,484
[Albert] You're an idiot, Tjaden.

543
00:44:07,192 --> 00:44:08,900
[Tjaden] Have you ever done
any peat digging?

544
00:44:08,984 --> 00:44:10,109
Try it sometime.

545
00:44:10,192 --> 00:44:12,484
[Albert] Can't be worse
than digging trenches in Champagne.

546
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:14,525
It takes longer
than digging trenches in Champagne.

547
00:44:14,609 --> 00:44:16,234
And you can't get away with not doing it.

548
00:44:16,859 --> 00:44:19,484
In peacetime military life,
you have no concerns.

549
00:44:20,025 --> 00:44:22,525
Mornings, food's there
or else you're not there.

550
00:44:23,275 --> 00:44:24,984
And then you have the softest bed.

551
00:44:25,067 --> 00:44:26,859
Every week with fresh sheets over it.

552
00:44:26,942 --> 00:44:27,775
And thenâ€¦

553
00:44:29,484 --> 00:44:31,067
And before you know it, I'm a corporal.

554
00:44:32,067 --> 00:44:35,150
Imagine that.
Me becoming a military policeman.

555
00:44:35,234 --> 00:44:37,067
A Cognac here, a pint there.

556
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:40,234
A military policeman
is everyone's good friend. Everyone.

557
00:44:40,317 --> 00:44:41,900
There's just one catch, Tjaden.

558
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:44,400
What's that?

559
00:44:44,484 --> 00:44:46,650
You'll never be a corporal though,
will you?

560
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,400
You always make such useless comments.

561
00:44:58,484 --> 00:45:00,109
What does it matter what you think anyway?

562
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:05,734
[engine sounds]

563
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:12,150
[shouting]

564
00:45:16,317 --> 00:45:17,984
-Kat! Kat!
-Here!

565
00:45:18,067 --> 00:45:19,109
-Kat!
-[Kat] Here!

566
00:45:19,192 --> 00:45:20,109
[Tjaden] Kat!

[gunfire and explosions in distance]

570
00:46:16,442 --> 00:46:17,317
"Darling one."

571
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:20,275
"You asked us
for a package of food to be sent."

572
00:46:21,067 --> 00:46:23,442
"Four portions of sausage
are on their way with lard."

573
00:46:25,859 --> 00:46:28,109
"A couple of pieces of cake."

574
00:46:29,192 --> 00:46:30,984
"Sauerkraut and smoked wurst."

575
00:46:31,942 --> 00:46:32,817
"Some moreâ€¦"

576
00:46:33,984 --> 00:46:35,775
-Hing? Hingfong?
-Hingfong.

577
00:46:36,275 --> 00:46:37,400
"â€¦and a cup of sugar."

578
00:46:38,609 --> 00:46:41,067
"Eggs and a glass of plum jam in there."

579
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:44,650
"Don't eat too quickly as I don't want
to have to send more right away."

580
00:46:45,817 --> 00:46:47,817
"I'd keep it away
from your comrades if I were you."

581
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:49,317
[laughs]

582
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,234
"My dear one."

583
00:46:51,234 --> 00:46:52,859
"I must also ask a question of you."

584
00:46:53,484 --> 00:46:55,359
"Have you started to save up any money?"

585
00:46:56,359 --> 00:46:58,359
"Could you send some home
would you think?"

586
00:46:59,192 --> 00:47:01,859
"People are saying the war
will be over soon." "Some people."

587
00:47:02,609 --> 00:47:04,817
"And so it would be helpful
to have some saved up."

588
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:07,734
"You're probably thinking,
'What is she after?'"

589
00:47:07,817 --> 00:47:09,525
"'How cheeky of her to ask.'"

590
00:47:10,359 --> 00:47:12,317
"But I mean not to offend you."

591
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,692
"You know me, I can never get enough."

592
00:47:15,275 --> 00:47:17,942
"But more, more." "I can't help it,
I always want some more."

593
00:47:18,609 --> 00:47:20,859
"So make sure not to fall over
before you can come home."

594
00:47:22,692 --> 00:47:25,984
"Karl Lemmer is in a hospital bed
somewhere in the East."

595
00:47:26,484 --> 00:47:27,609
"Something with his stomach."

596
00:47:28,192 --> 00:47:30,442
"And he was out there
for barely three weeks in total."

597
00:47:32,025 --> 00:47:34,484
"Can't you also be sick,
with your rheumatism?"

598
00:47:35,942 --> 00:47:37,734
"You've already played your role."

599
00:47:37,817 --> 00:47:39,025
[laughs]

600
00:47:39,109 --> 00:47:42,275
If only she could see
how you're sitting there, with your cigar.

601
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:43,984
[both laugh]

602
00:47:46,359 --> 00:47:48,067
"This Sunday, I'll visit the graâ€¦"

603
00:47:54,734 --> 00:47:57,275
"This Sunday,
I'll visit the grave of our boy."

604
00:48:00,692 --> 00:48:03,775
"I'll make sure to read to him
as you remember he loved that."

605
00:48:05,859 --> 00:48:09,359
"By next year, we'll be able to celebrate
his tenth birthday together."

606
00:48:12,192 --> 00:48:13,817
"That's all I have to tell you this time."

607
00:48:14,567 --> 00:48:16,817
"Sending kisses from your wife, for you."

608
00:48:17,525 --> 00:48:18,442
"<i>Auf Wiedersehen</i>."

609
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:23,817
[sniffs]

610
00:48:24,984 --> 00:48:25,900
I had no idea.

611
00:48:35,317 --> 00:48:36,650
Oh, Paul.

612
00:48:41,734 --> 00:48:43,359
How is all this going to work out, hmm?

613
00:48:45,275 --> 00:48:46,650
Returning to a home,

614
00:48:47,984 --> 00:48:49,900
having to go back to our normal being.

615
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:54,109
Where all everyone wants to know about
are the battles we've been in.

616
00:48:56,942 --> 00:49:00,275
We'll be like travellers
who belong in another country elsewhere.

617
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,650
Sometimes I wonderâ€¦

618
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:06,692
Wouldâ€¦

619
00:49:06,775 --> 00:49:10,150
Would I be happier with you here at camp?

620
00:49:10,234 --> 00:49:11,984
Tjaden and Kropp.

621
00:49:13,192 --> 00:49:15,067
And with Muller. He'd be sat with us.

622
00:49:16,775 --> 00:49:18,317
And be eating fried potatoes.

623
00:49:19,109 --> 00:49:20,067
Unpeeled.

624
00:49:27,067 --> 00:49:28,109
Wellâ€¦

625
00:49:35,817 --> 00:49:37,984
[grunts, clears throat]

626
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,025
That's enough of that.

627
00:49:43,859 --> 00:49:46,192
How long until we finally get going again?

628
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:49,817
[shouting] How long
until we finally get going again?

629

[horse snorts]

630
00:50:08,359 --> 00:50:09,234
Franz?

631
00:50:09,984 --> 00:50:10,817
[Franz] Yes?

632
00:50:12,484 --> 00:50:14,234
Tomorrow, we're up at six o'clock.

633
00:50:14,317 --> 00:50:15,859
To look for some children.

634
00:50:16,692 --> 00:50:17,609
What happened?

635
00:50:19,275 --> 00:50:20,817
[Paul] They should have arrived today.

636
00:50:21,317 --> 00:50:22,359
A whole company.

637
00:50:27,234 --> 00:50:28,067
How was it?

638
00:50:32,359 --> 00:50:33,650
-Good.
-[Paul] Yeah?

639
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,234
Yes.

640
00:50:37,692 --> 00:50:38,525
Here.

641

[sniffs]

642
00:50:43,942 --> 00:50:44,817
Have a smell.

643
00:50:50,317 --> 00:50:51,150
[laughs]

644
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:58,734
[Paul] What's her name?

645
00:50:58,817 --> 00:50:59,817
Eloise.

646
00:51:02,567 --> 00:51:03,484
Eloise.

647
00:51:04,525 --> 00:51:07,692
[Franz] She had skin as white as milk.

648
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:11,650
Breastsâ€¦

649
00:51:13,234 --> 00:51:14,484
-[Albert] Hey.
-Huh?

650
00:51:15,067 --> 00:51:16,317
[Albert] I want to smell it too.

651
00:51:20,192 --> 00:51:21,192
Kropp, let me have it.

652
00:51:22,025 --> 00:51:23,775
-Here.
-[Tjaden] Oh, my.

653
00:51:23,859 --> 00:51:24,734
Give it to me.

654
00:51:24,817 --> 00:51:27,692
[Tjaden] A girl like that
never has dirt under her nails.

655
00:51:27,775 --> 00:51:30,067
-No.
-At worst, some sand from the seashore.

656
00:51:30,734 --> 00:51:31,942
[Franz] Tjaden.

657
00:51:32,025 --> 00:51:34,567
-Come on, pass it here.
-[Tjaden] I bet she bathes twice a day.

Sir.

663
00:52:05,692 --> 00:52:06,859
Call the others.

664
00:52:45,734 --> 00:52:47,317
There must have been a huge explosion.

665
00:52:48,442 --> 00:52:49,859
[Kat] Mine thrower cannons.

666
00:52:50,525 --> 00:52:52,650
He's been blasted
right out of his uniform.

667
00:52:58,067 --> 00:52:59,609
Was he one of those we've come here for?

668
00:53:00,234 --> 00:53:02,567
[Kat] No, they've only been missing
since yesterday.

669
00:53:03,567 --> 00:53:05,359
[Tjaden] He's been hanging there
for some time.

670
00:53:06,192 --> 00:53:07,109
Not pleasant.

671
00:53:07,942 --> 00:53:09,359
[Kat] Don't get soft now, men.

672
00:53:10,025 --> 00:53:11,400
[Paul] How many are we looking for?

673
00:53:11,484 --> 00:53:13,025
[Tjaden] Sixty young recruits.

674
00:53:20,525 --> 00:53:21,942
Breakfast is turnip bread.

675
00:53:22,442 --> 00:53:23,900
Same at lunchtime, it's turnip bread.

676
00:53:23,984 --> 00:53:26,567
I'm surrounded by turnip bread.
I can't face it any more.

677
00:53:27,192 --> 00:53:29,942
Let me know when you find them.
I'm not going any further.

678
00:53:30,859 --> 00:53:31,734
Gas.

679
00:53:35,025 --> 00:53:36,067
There was gas here.

684
00:55:00,275 --> 00:55:01,275
I'm Kropp.

685
00:55:05,775 --> 00:55:06,692
And you?

Do you want toâ€¦

689
00:55:24,317 --> 00:55:25,900
Do you want to come with me?

690
00:55:28,067 --> 00:55:28,900

Stupid boys.
They took their masks off too soon.

Well, Brixdorf, what's the latest?

711
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,025
The French are increasing the pressure.

712
00:58:28,109 --> 00:58:30,817
Early this morning,
our reconnaissance intercepted orders

713

00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:37,859
Must mean an attack is likely.

716
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:42,400
The social democrats
will be the end of mankind, Brixdorf.

717
00:58:44,942 --> 00:58:45,859
General?

718
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,317
I have just put a German delegation
to the armistice negotiations

719
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:54,900
on the train to Compiegne.

720
00:59:02,025 --> 00:59:05,484
These people, Brixdorf,
are selling out our fatherland.

721
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:08,567
My orders are war.

722
00:59:09,775 --> 00:59:13,317
And all the while that is the case,
I shall fight for every meter.

723
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:18,067
We have to hold on now
and wait for fresh troops.

724
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:20,900
In a few months, the incoming class
of recruits will be here.

725
00:59:22,109 --> 00:59:23,942
The French are trying everything they can

726
00:59:24,025 --> 00:59:26,567
to force
their completely unacceptable terms on us.

727
00:59:29,192 --> 00:59:30,859
I will not capitulate.

728
00:59:33,734 --> 00:59:36,650
We must strike without delay.
With all our might.

729
00:59:39,442 --> 00:59:40,275
[clicks heels]

730
00:59:41,984 --> 00:59:42,900

733
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:06,484
From our position,

734
01:00:08,317 --> 01:00:09,775
I have to be clearâ€¦

735
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:12,317
We all have to be clearâ€¦

736
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,692
[train screeches]

737
01:00:13,775 --> 01:00:14,859
For God's sake.

738
01:00:15,442 --> 01:00:16,359
Shit.

739
01:00:16,859 --> 01:00:19,984
[train screeches to a halt]

740
01:00:40,275 --> 01:00:41,442

[horse neighing]

742
01:00:48,859 --> 01:00:49,692
[soldier] Sir!

743
01:01:00,442 --> 01:01:02,109
[lieutenant] Soldiers, pack your bags,

744
01:01:02,192 --> 01:01:04,942
roll up your bedding,
and wash your mess kits.

745
01:01:05,025 --> 01:01:08,317
The whole regiment will advance
to the front firing position.

746
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,567
And I mean everyone
who's able to stand on two legs is going.

747
01:01:12,734 --> 01:01:14,775
Line up, for God's sake.

748
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:18,567
You think the Frenchies will wait
for you to comb your pubes?

749
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:20,317
-Here we go again.
-[lieutenant] Get moving!

750
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:23,025
-Where to?
-Where to? Where to?

751
01:01:23,525 --> 01:01:24,525
Into battle.

752
01:01:25,484 --> 01:01:27,484

[interpreter clears throat]

757
01:02:59,775 --> 01:03:01,650
Monsieur le Marechal is awaiting you.

758
01:03:07,567 --> 01:03:09,567
[ominous music continues]

762
01:04:09,359 --> 01:04:10,525
I'll come back for you.

763
01:04:26,067 --> 01:04:27,150
Envious, huh?

764
01:04:36,942 --> 01:04:38,942
[ominous music intensifies]

765
01:04:45,275 --> 01:04:46,525
I stand before you

766
01:04:47,067 --> 01:04:50,984
in the hope that you will take
our presence here today as an opportunity

767
01:04:51,067 --> 01:04:53,734
to take action to suspend all hostilities.

768
01:04:55,192 --> 01:04:56,734
In the name of humanity,

769
01:04:57,525 --> 01:05:00,525
I'm here asking you for an agreement
to an immediate cease-fire

770
01:05:00,609 --> 01:05:03,692
for the entire duration
of our negotiating time

771
01:05:03,775 --> 01:05:07,150
in order to spare
our nation's unnecessary depletion.

772
01:05:07,234 --> 01:05:09,067
[interpreter speaks French]

773
01:05:09,150 --> 01:05:12,400
Matthias Erzberger,
head of the German delegation.

[interpreter speaks French]

775
01:05:22,317 --> 01:05:24,234
[in French] Weygand,
what do these gentlemen want?

776
01:05:25,150 --> 01:05:26,650
I don't know.

777
01:05:26,734 --> 01:05:29,609
[in English] Marshal Foch asks
what brings you gentlemen to him.

778
01:05:33,609 --> 01:05:35,650
We are here looking forward to hearing

779
01:05:36,484 --> 01:05:39,234
your proposal for an enduring cease-fire

780
01:05:39,317 --> 01:05:42,442
that will include all those on the water,
on land, as well as in the sky.

781
01:05:42,525 --> 01:05:43,859
[interpreter speaks French]

782

[Foch speaks French]

783
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:48,650
I have no proposal
of this kind to make.

784
01:05:51,692 --> 01:05:52,775
What does he mean by that?

785
01:05:53,609 --> 01:05:56,775
I think he disliked the phrasing
of what you said.

786
01:05:58,317 --> 01:05:59,234
Yes.

787
01:05:59,734 --> 01:06:00,942
Good, thenâ€¦

788
01:06:04,525 --> 01:06:05,609
Monsieur Le Marechal,

789
01:06:05,692 --> 01:06:09,359
[in French] If you please,
we would like to know the conditions--

[speaks French]

792
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,484
[In English] He wants you
to ask for it, formally.

793
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:29,359
Monsieur le Marechal,

794
01:06:31,734 --> 01:06:33,692
I am asking you for an armistice.

[in French] We are asking
for an armistice.

796

You have 72 hours
to accept our conditions.

[in English] You have 72 hours
to accept our conditions.

798
01:06:48,067 --> 01:06:49,984
They are non-negotiable.

799
01:06:50,067 --> 01:06:51,442
Seventy-two hours?

800
01:06:51,525 --> 01:06:53,150
The war will continue until you sign them.

801
01:06:53,234 --> 01:06:54,317
Monsieur le Marechal,

802
01:06:54,817 --> 01:06:58,109
in God's name,
don't let 72 hours pass us by here.

803
01:06:59,609 --> 01:07:01,984
-Thousands of lives depend on it.
-[interpreter speaks French]

804

01:19:54,775 --> 01:19:57,150
Even if we end up
losing definitively after all,

897
01:19:57,234 --> 01:19:59,567
we won't be worse off
than we are with this surrender.

898
01:19:59,650 --> 01:20:01,650
Except for
a few hundred thousand extra deaths.

899
01:20:01,734 --> 01:20:03,567
Alsace-Lorraine,
occupation of the Rhineland,

900
01:20:03,650 --> 01:20:05,817
cannons, locomotives,
trains, and whatever else.

901
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:08,025
You are aware,
this is a total capitulation.

902
01:20:08,109 --> 01:20:12,442
250,000 Americans
are landing each month in Europe.

903
01:20:12,525 --> 01:20:16,067
Marne, Cantigny, Cambrai.
All of those lost.

904
01:20:17,109 --> 01:20:19,109
All that's left
separating us from an armistice

905
01:20:19,192 --> 01:20:20,775
is false pride, as I see it.

906
01:20:20,859 --> 01:20:22,192
Thanks to you and your commanders,

907
01:20:22,275 --> 01:20:24,442
we're here dealing with the mess
left by them.

908
01:20:24,525 --> 01:20:26,984
I'm happy for you to depart here,
it's down to you.

909
01:20:27,067 --> 01:20:28,192
We are remaining here.

910
01:20:34,650 --> 01:20:35,734
It is winter.

911
01:20:36,984 --> 01:20:40,025
Without trains and provisions,
Bolshevism will take over.

912
01:20:40,859 --> 01:20:42,859
On their way home,
the men will die of hunger

913
01:20:42,942 --> 01:20:45,359
instead of dying
with honour on the battlefield.

914
01:20:46,609 --> 01:20:47,484
Honour?

915
01:20:49,442 --> 01:20:52,275
My son was killed in the war.
He doesn't feel any honour.

916
01:20:58,567 --> 01:20:59,692
Von Helldorf.

917
01:21:00,692 --> 01:21:03,109
Please get a few copies
of the conditions of their proposal

918
01:21:03,192 --> 01:21:05,359
and telegraph them to headquarters.

919
01:21:05,442 --> 01:21:06,775
You inform the government.

920
01:21:10,275 --> 01:21:12,317
We have 72 hours left here, gentlemen,

921
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,734
and during every minute
we waste by talking about it,

922
01:21:14,817 --> 01:21:16,275
there dies another soldier.

923
01:21:17,192 --> 01:21:20,650
Let us gain mercy where we can,
but for God's sake,

924
01:21:21,484 --> 01:21:22,567
let's make peace.

925
01:21:23,359 --> 01:21:25,359
-[explosions and gunfire]
-[screaming and shouting]

926
01:21:25,442 --> 01:21:26,984
[grunting]

927
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:10,234
[in French] Retreat! Retreat!

928
01:22:15,234 --> 01:22:17,317
[in English] Run! Run!

929
01:22:17,817 --> 01:22:20,067
Keep firing!

930
01:22:37,109 --> 01:22:39,109
[grunting]

931
01:23:17,567 --> 01:23:18,984
[groaning]

932
01:23:19,067 --> 01:23:20,109
Shut up!

933
01:23:49,359 --> 01:23:51,359
[sombre music playing]

934
01:24:04,442 --> 01:24:05,442
Shut up!

935
01:24:08,650 --> 01:24:09,775
That's enough!

936
01:24:10,609 --> 01:24:12,609
[crying]

937
01:24:30,859 --> 01:24:32,859
[soldier spluttering]

938
01:24:59,484 --> 01:25:00,525
[gasping]

939
01:25:04,984 --> 01:25:05,859
[sobs]

940
01:26:04,275 --> 01:26:05,400
[screams]

941
01:26:05,484 --> 01:26:06,692
No, no, no.

942
01:26:07,317 --> 01:26:08,150
Comrade.

943
01:26:09,234 --> 01:26:11,192
Comrade, comrade.

944
01:27:13,609 --> 01:27:14,525
[in French] So sorry.

945
01:27:15,942 --> 01:27:17,025
So sorry.

946
01:27:17,984 --> 01:27:20,192
I am so sorry. I am so sorry.

947
01:27:57,734 --> 01:28:00,275
DUVAL, GERARD
TYPOGRAPHER

948
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:15,859
Your wifeâ€¦

949
01:28:17,859 --> 01:28:18,984
Your wifeâ€¦

950
01:28:20,609 --> 01:28:22,275
I promiseâ€¦ I promiseâ€¦

951
01:28:23,692 --> 01:28:24,650
I promiseâ€¦

952
01:28:43,650 --> 01:28:45,650
[birds calling]

953
01:29:01,650 --> 01:29:03,650
[birds calling]

954
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:08,859
[footsteps sound]

955
01:29:29,775 --> 01:29:31,775
[orchestral music playing]

956
01:29:41,150 --> 01:29:43,150
[footsteps sound]

957
01:29:53,192 --> 01:29:54,525
[sighs]

958
01:30:01,775 --> 01:30:03,775
[footsteps sound]

959
01:30:12,484 --> 01:30:14,109
When were you born, Brixdorf?

960
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:18,275
1877, in June.

961
01:30:20,275 --> 01:30:21,692
A summer child.

962
01:30:22,775 --> 01:30:23,609
Yes.

963
01:30:26,859 --> 01:30:28,067
What about your father?

964
01:30:30,359 --> 01:30:32,609
My family live in Holstein
and he has a factory there.

965
01:30:33,150 --> 01:30:35,525
[swallow, sighs] Producing what?

966
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:38,692
Riding saddles, general.

967
01:30:39,192 --> 01:30:40,359
Riding saddles.

968
01:30:42,067 --> 01:30:45,442
Something that will always sell.
Your future is secure then.

969
01:30:47,109 --> 01:30:48,442
I am indeed fortunate.

970
01:30:50,817 --> 01:30:51,692
And?

971
01:30:52,650 --> 01:30:54,234
Are you looking forward to going home?

972
01:30:55,525 --> 01:30:57,900
-When we are no longer needed here?
-Yes.

973
01:30:59,567 --> 01:31:02,734
After the war,
a position of responsibility awaits me.

974
01:31:03,567 --> 01:31:05,650
-I will take over the business.
-Mhm.

975
01:31:06,817 --> 01:31:07,942
Congratulations.

976
01:31:08,567 --> 01:31:09,484
And you?

977
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:12,984
I'm a soldier.

978
01:31:14,817 --> 01:31:17,067
My father was an officer in this regiment.

979
01:31:18,317 --> 01:31:20,525
He fought in the three wars
under Bismarck.

980
01:31:21,234 --> 01:31:22,692
He won all three of them.

981
01:31:23,275 --> 01:31:25,567
In 1871, he marched on Paris

982
01:31:26,234 --> 01:31:28,067
and when he returned, he was a hero.

983
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:34,109
I was too late in being born, Brixdorf.

984
01:31:35,775 --> 01:31:37,734
It's been 50 years of no war.

985
01:31:39,150 --> 01:31:40,692
What is a soldier without war?

986
01:31:47,859 --> 01:31:49,484
Were you and your father close?

987
01:31:50,984 --> 01:31:52,442
[general] As a child, maybe.

988
01:31:54,692 --> 01:31:56,859
A man is alone when born.

989
01:31:57,484 --> 01:31:58,567
He lives alone

990
01:31:59,650 --> 01:32:01,192
and on his deathbed is alone.

991
01:32:24,817 --> 01:32:26,817
-[brush scratches]
-[heavy breathing]

992
01:32:31,150 --> 01:32:32,275
THE KAISER HAS ABDICATED

993
01:32:32,359 --> 01:32:33,984
-[knocking on door]
-Come in.

994
01:32:35,359 --> 01:32:38,484
-Von Helldorf. How can I help you?
-[Von Helldorf] Hindenburg.

995
01:32:38,567 --> 01:32:39,859
[Erzberger] Open it immediately.

996
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:47,775
[Von Helldorf] He urges us to sign.

997
01:32:48,567 --> 01:32:49,609
[exhales]

998
01:32:50,192 --> 01:32:51,192
[distant shouting]

999
01:32:51,275 --> 01:32:53,525
-[soldier 1] It's over!
-[soldier 2] We're going home!

1000
01:32:53,609 --> 01:32:55,817
[screams] We're going home!

1001
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:58,067
[soldier 1] Back to our families.

1002
01:32:58,150 --> 01:33:00,150
[ominous music playing]

1003
01:33:04,109 --> 01:33:06,359
[shouting and laughter]

1004
01:33:06,442 --> 01:33:10,942
In the name of all
who are living in a world of sin.

1005
01:33:11,025 --> 01:33:14,650
We are surrounded by it now in the filth.

1006
01:33:15,150 --> 01:33:16,817
[cheering]

1007
01:33:16,900 --> 01:33:18,234
Knock on the monastery's door

1008
01:33:18,317 --> 01:33:21,484
and you'll find
only thieves and scoundrels.

1009
01:33:21,567 --> 01:33:24,359
It's finally over.
The fat pigs finally get it.

1010
01:33:24,442 --> 01:33:28,609
They're negotiating at last.
We're going home soon, do you hear that?

1011
01:33:33,317 --> 01:33:34,900
Are there any sergeants left?

1012
01:33:41,359 --> 01:33:44,067
[screaming]

1013
01:33:44,150 --> 01:33:46,234
[army doctor] Chloroform the man,
for God's sake.

1014
01:33:49,234 --> 01:33:51,859
[agonized screams]

1015
01:34:00,525 --> 01:34:01,442
[Tjaden] Baumer.

1016
01:34:02,609 --> 01:34:03,442
Baumer.

1017
01:34:08,734 --> 01:34:09,817
Baumer.

1018
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:11,525
Tjaden? Tjaden.

1019
01:34:13,775 --> 01:34:14,775
What happened?

1020
01:34:15,442 --> 01:34:16,442
Where have you been hit?

1021
01:34:16,525 --> 01:34:17,609
Above the knee.

1022
01:34:18,859 --> 01:34:20,317
Or somewhere down there.

1023
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:21,775
I can't feel anything.

1024
01:34:22,692 --> 01:34:24,275
How far up is the shot?

1025
01:34:25,317 --> 01:34:26,650
I can't raise my head.

1026
01:34:28,650 --> 01:34:30,109
Ten centimetres, it seems.

1027
01:34:34,859 --> 01:34:36,067
You're going home soon, Tjaden.

1028
01:34:36,150 --> 01:34:38,109
-You think so?
-[Paul] Yes, you are.

1029
01:34:42,817 --> 01:34:45,150
It's unlikely the police force
will have me, though.

1030
01:34:47,150 --> 01:34:48,275
God damn shit.

1031
01:34:49,484 --> 01:34:50,859
[Paul] You can still do it.

1032
01:34:53,025 --> 01:34:54,150
Just wait and see.

1033
01:34:54,942 --> 01:34:56,859
I'm not going to let them amputate me.

1034
01:34:58,275 --> 01:35:00,234
I'm not living as a cripple in this world.

1035
01:35:00,775 --> 01:35:02,025
[Paul] You won't have to.

1036
01:35:02,109 --> 01:35:04,359
There are others who are worse off
that they've patched up.

1037
01:35:08,734 --> 01:35:10,234
Oh, dear Paul.

1038
01:35:10,942 --> 01:35:12,400
I have something to give you.

1039
01:35:24,859 --> 01:35:26,859
[sniffs]

1040
01:35:44,317 --> 01:35:45,275
Is he dead?

1041
01:35:51,067 --> 01:35:52,692
You must show braveness.

1042
01:35:54,359 --> 01:35:55,609
You're alive, remember?

1043
01:35:55,692 --> 01:35:57,525
For that, you have to be grateful.

1044
01:35:58,359 --> 01:35:59,359
For us.

1045
01:35:59,442 --> 01:36:01,734
-For those who didn't make it.
-That's enough.

1046
01:36:01,817 --> 01:36:04,317
Look here. You mustn't say that. Not you.

1047
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:11,400
[chattering]

1048
01:36:19,775 --> 01:36:21,067
[soldier 1] Good feeling, right?

1049
01:36:22,275 --> 01:36:23,359
Have a bit of that, then.

1050
01:36:23,942 --> 01:36:25,650
[soldier 2] Yeah,
dry your socks out there.

1051
01:36:26,150 --> 01:36:27,734
[soldier 1] The way the last summer wasâ€¦

1052
01:36:28,734 --> 01:36:30,567
[laughter]

1053
01:36:32,484 --> 01:36:33,567
[soldier 1] Right, noneâ€¦

1054
01:36:35,775 --> 01:36:36,859
You see?

1055
01:36:36,942 --> 01:36:38,359
-Not like the last one.
-[laughter]

1056
01:36:39,734 --> 01:36:41,484
[soldier 1] That was tooâ€¦

1057
01:36:42,359 --> 01:36:44,692
[singing]

1058
01:36:44,775 --> 01:36:46,567
[soldier 2] You always blame me.

1059
01:36:46,650 --> 01:36:49,484
-[soldier 1] We saw you!
--[soldier 2] What did you see me doing?

1060
01:36:49,567 --> 01:36:50,525
[all laugh]

1061
01:36:50,609 --> 01:36:51,650
[soldier 1] Come on!

1062
01:36:52,775 --> 01:36:54,150
Nah, we know it was you.

1063
01:36:54,234 --> 01:36:55,859
[soldier 2] Why is it always on me?

1064
01:36:56,942 --> 01:36:58,609
[shouting]

1065
01:36:58,692 --> 01:37:00,692
[organ music playing]

1066
01:37:10,484 --> 01:37:12,900
Do you have shit for brains?
Why won't you listen?

1067
01:37:13,442 --> 01:37:15,567
You have been given
a second company's provisions.

1068
01:37:16,192 --> 01:37:18,775
-We are that second company!
-[cheering]

1069
01:37:18,859 --> 01:37:20,942
So dish it out! Give it to us!

1070
01:37:21,025 --> 01:37:21,942
[Paul] Kat?

1071
01:37:22,734 --> 01:37:23,900
-Kat!
-[Kat] Paul?

1072
01:37:23,984 --> 01:37:24,817
[Paul] Kat!

1073
01:37:25,692 --> 01:37:26,609
[Kat] Paul!

1074
01:37:27,192 --> 01:37:28,817
-Paul!
-[Paul] Kat, you were alive.

1075
01:37:28,900 --> 01:37:30,525
-[Kat] Paul!
-You're alive!

1076
01:37:30,609 --> 01:37:31,525
[Kat] Paul.

1077
01:37:39,859 --> 01:37:41,109
[Paul] Tjaden was hit.

1078
01:37:41,192 --> 01:37:42,484
He's lying inside the church.

1079
01:37:43,984 --> 01:37:45,650
He'll get a double portion from us.

1080
01:37:45,734 --> 01:37:46,609
[Paul] Yes.

1081
01:37:51,109 --> 01:37:52,775
Another one. In here.

1082
01:37:55,484 --> 01:37:58,567
-[Paul] I thought you were dead.
-[Kat] Ha!

1083
01:37:59,525 --> 01:38:00,900
At some point, we'll all die.

1084
01:38:01,942 --> 01:38:03,317
[Paul] But not on the home stretch.

1085
01:38:05,609 --> 01:38:07,317
[Kat] If you die before me, I'll kill you.

1086
01:38:08,734 --> 01:38:10,567
-Ha!
-[Paul laughs]

1087
01:38:13,817 --> 01:38:14,650
[Kat] Tjaden.

1088
01:38:16,775 --> 01:38:17,692
Tjaden.

1089
01:38:21,900 --> 01:38:22,734
Yes.

1090
01:38:23,525 --> 01:38:24,734
-Kat?
-[Kat] Yes.

1091
01:38:29,067 --> 01:38:30,817
-Kat.
-[laughs]

1092
01:38:30,900 --> 01:38:32,400
I've soup here for you.

1093
01:38:32,484 --> 01:38:33,900
[Tjaden] Have you brought cutlery?

1094
01:38:33,984 --> 01:38:36,109
Yes, we brought cutlery as well.

1095
01:38:41,484 --> 01:38:42,900
There you go. Eat up.

1096
01:38:46,609 --> 01:38:47,442
[slurping]

1097
01:39:04,609 --> 01:39:05,984
[groaning]

1098
01:39:07,317 --> 01:39:09,817
Stop, stop, Tjaden, Tjaden!

1099
01:39:10,317 --> 01:39:11,317
Stop!

1100
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:16,609
We need help over here!

1101
01:39:17,859 --> 01:39:19,275
What made you do that?

1102
01:39:19,359 --> 01:39:20,275
Why would you?

1103
01:39:21,192 --> 01:39:22,942
It's over for me.

1104
01:39:23,025 --> 01:39:24,400
[Paul] He's bleeding out!

1105
01:39:29,359 --> 01:39:30,234
Tjaden.

1106
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:36,275
Tjaden.

1107
01:40:04,734 --> 01:40:06,984
[sombre music playing]

1108
01:40:20,150 --> 01:40:21,525
[distant explosion sounds]

1109
01:41:10,859 --> 01:41:11,775
[Kat] What is it?

1110
01:41:14,025 --> 01:41:15,109
[Paul] I've lost something.

1111
01:41:19,984 --> 01:41:21,359
Kat, do you speak French?

1112
01:41:22,025 --> 01:41:24,275
[Kat] Mm.
<i>S'il vous plait. S'il vous plait.</i>

1113
01:41:28,567 --> 01:41:30,650
My mother always said
it was French I should learn.

1114
01:41:30,734 --> 01:41:31,609
Aha.

1115
01:41:31,692 --> 01:41:32,984
[glass bottle rolls]

1116
01:41:35,025 --> 01:41:35,984
And the piano.

1117
01:41:38,525 --> 01:41:40,067
She also warned me of war.

1118
01:41:40,567 --> 01:41:41,692
She didn't want me to go.

1119
01:41:41,775 --> 01:41:44,650
"That's not for you," she always said.
"You'll be dead in no time."

1120
01:41:47,067 --> 01:41:48,692
I wanted to show that I could do it.

1121
01:41:49,692 --> 01:41:51,109
[Kat] What use is that now?

1122
01:41:54,692 --> 01:41:56,567
"A couple of weeks, we'll be in Paris."

1123
01:41:59,317 --> 01:42:02,359
These past two years of grenades
can't be shed like an item of clothing.

1124
01:42:02,442 --> 01:42:05,109
-[Kat] Paul.
-The stench will remain on us forever.

1125
01:42:05,192 --> 01:42:07,109
-Enough.
-Ludwig is dead. Franz is dead. Albert--

1126
01:42:07,192 --> 01:42:08,525
Is that to do with us?

1127
01:42:09,734 --> 01:42:11,317
They don't suffer any more.

1128
01:42:11,817 --> 01:42:12,775
Peace for them.

1129
01:42:14,942 --> 01:42:16,442
We're still alive.

1130
01:42:18,692 --> 01:42:19,984
[distant chatter]

1131
01:42:20,859 --> 01:42:22,525
Everything here is like a fever.

1132
01:42:23,275 --> 01:42:25,400
Not one person wants it
but suddenly it's there.

1133
01:42:26,609 --> 01:42:28,775
We didn't ask for it.
The others didn't ask for it.

1134
01:42:28,859 --> 01:42:30,067
But nonetheless it happened

1135
01:42:30,150 --> 01:42:32,150
and nonetheless half the world
is involved, mind you.

1136
01:42:32,234 --> 01:42:33,359
God looks down

1137
01:42:34,775 --> 01:42:36,067
at us murderers.

1138
01:42:40,484 --> 01:42:41,484
Yeah, well.

1139
01:42:42,984 --> 01:42:44,109
[exhales]

1140
01:42:45,234 --> 01:42:46,359
But what do I know?

1141
01:42:46,942 --> 01:42:47,859
Nothing.

1142
01:42:48,650 --> 01:42:50,192
I'm a pair of boots with a rifle.

1143
01:42:52,442 --> 01:42:54,400
Get some rest. We're the lucky ones.

1144
01:42:54,900 --> 01:42:55,734
Yes.

1145
01:43:13,775 --> 01:43:14,650
Kat?

1146
01:43:15,609 --> 01:43:16,692
[Kat] Mm.

1147
01:43:18,817 --> 01:43:20,150
[Paul] What did your son die of?

1148
01:43:25,567 --> 01:43:26,400
The pox.

1149
01:43:35,025 --> 01:43:36,692
I'm afraid of what's to come.

1150
01:43:44,067 --> 01:43:44,984
Don't be.

1151
01:43:49,942 --> 01:43:51,942
[ominous music playing]

1152
01:44:03,650 --> 01:44:05,650
[ominous music intensifies]

1153
01:44:17,192 --> 01:44:18,109
[in French] Henri.

1154
01:44:21,692 --> 01:44:22,817
Taste it.

1155
01:44:26,817 --> 01:44:27,900
Were they made today?

1156
01:44:30,900 --> 01:44:32,859
I'm sorry, sir. I don't think so.

1157
01:44:33,859 --> 01:44:34,692
Hmm.

1158
01:44:46,359 --> 01:44:48,359
[drum beats sound]

1159
01:44:57,275 --> 01:44:58,442
Monsieur le Marechal.

1160
01:45:05,859 --> 01:45:06,984
I'm listening.

1161
01:45:07,067 --> 01:45:09,025
[Erzberger, in English] The Kaiser
has abdicated.

1162
01:45:09,109 --> 01:45:13,650
Soldiers are refusing to obey orders.
Deserters are roaming the countryside.

1163
01:45:13,734 --> 01:45:16,234
The new government
will do everything it can

1164
01:45:16,317 --> 01:45:18,859
to fulfil the duties imposed on it,

1165
01:45:18,942 --> 01:45:22,692
but the population,
through no fault of its own,

1166
01:45:23,359 --> 01:45:25,734
faces hunger and anarchy setting in.

1167
01:45:25,817 --> 01:45:29,025
[in French] This is a disease
of the defeated, not of the victorious.

1168
01:45:29,109 --> 01:45:30,484
I don't fear it.

1169
01:45:30,567 --> 01:45:32,192
I reject any compromise.

1170
01:45:32,275 --> 01:45:33,859
[in English] I reject any compromise.

1171
01:45:33,942 --> 01:45:36,025
Monsieur le Marechal, please.

1172
01:45:37,234 --> 01:45:40,484
Be fair to your opponent
or else this peace will be hated.

1173
01:45:40,567 --> 01:45:41,525
[in French] Fair?

1174
01:45:44,859 --> 01:45:46,442
You speak of fairness?

1175
01:46:00,609 --> 01:46:01,734
Sign it.

1176
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:07,359
[sighs]

1177
01:46:23,067 --> 01:46:25,067
[pen scraping]

1178
01:47:06,234 --> 01:47:07,650
[in English] Let the minutes record.

1179
01:47:07,734 --> 01:47:09,192
[watch ticking]

1180
01:47:09,275 --> 01:47:13,067
The armistice here signed
shall take effect in six hours from now

1181
01:47:13,150 --> 01:47:16,900
at the eleventh hour, on the eleventh day
of the eleventh month.

1182
01:47:19,359 --> 01:47:20,650
[Foch, in French] Very good.

1183
01:47:21,275 --> 01:47:22,400
The war is over.

1184
01:47:24,484 --> 01:47:26,484
[cheering and gunfire]

1185
01:47:36,567 --> 01:47:38,567
[Brixdorf, in English]
What are you going to do now?

1186
01:47:38,650 --> 01:47:39,484
[watch ticking]

1187
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:41,984
What do you see here, Brixdorf?

1188
01:47:44,234 --> 01:47:46,025
The plains of Latierre, general.

1189
01:47:46,109 --> 01:47:46,984
Eguisac.

1190
01:47:47,984 --> 01:47:49,234
I see them too.

1191
01:47:50,442 --> 01:47:53,150
But also German soldiers
running away like cowards.

1192
01:47:55,025 --> 01:47:57,317
The French troops are farting
on our position in Latierre

1193
01:47:57,400 --> 01:47:59,942
and outside there's a train
crammed full of horse fuckers

1194
01:48:00,025 --> 01:48:01,317
who are selling the homeland off.

1195
01:48:05,525 --> 01:48:07,442
See to it that all recruits are withdrawn.

1196
01:48:08,734 --> 01:48:10,067
Have them all report here.

1197
01:48:10,734 --> 01:48:13,275
We're going to sort out this pile of shit!

1198
01:48:13,359 --> 01:48:15,359
[footsteps fade]

1199
01:48:15,442 --> 01:48:17,442
[sombre music playing]

1200
01:48:24,067 --> 01:48:28,400
[voice on radio] <i>Any communication</i>
<i>with the enemy remains prohibited.</i>

1201
01:48:28,484 --> 01:48:33,400
<i>Firstly, hostilities on the entire front</i>

1202
01:48:33,484 --> 01:48:35,650
<i>November 11th at eleven o'clock.</i>

01:48:49,484 --> 01:48:50,525
[Paul] What time is it?

1208
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:58,400
-Why aren't you asleep?
-Listen a minute.

1209
01:49:01,984 --> 01:49:03,109
It's so still.

1210
01:49:05,650 --> 01:49:07,025
I must be going deaf.

1211
01:49:13,400 --> 01:49:14,775
They've signed, Paul.

1212
01:49:19,525 --> 01:49:20,567
The war's over.

1213
01:49:22,525 --> 01:49:23,484
It's over.

1214
01:49:29,234 --> 01:49:30,234
Are you hungry?

1215
01:49:31,192 --> 01:49:32,359
I'm hungry.

1216
01:49:37,359 --> 01:49:38,775
[Paul] Where are you going?

1217
01:49:38,859 --> 01:49:40,984
[Kat] Come on,
before the bastard wakes up.

1218
01:49:43,109 --> 01:49:46,192
-What are you doing for Christmas, Paul?
-[Paul] I don't know.

1219
01:49:46,275 --> 01:49:48,025
[Kat] I'm gonna roast a goose.

1220
01:49:48,609 --> 01:49:50,317
Red cabbage, potatoesâ€¦

1221
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:53,025
Then I'll light all the candles
and kiss my wife.

1222
01:49:53,109 --> 01:49:55,734
My God, Paul, she is beautiful.

1223
01:49:55,817 --> 01:49:56,859
[Paul] Yeah?

1224
01:49:56,942 --> 01:49:59,234
-What does she look like?
-[Kat] Wellâ€¦

1225
01:49:59,817 --> 01:50:02,150
Long curly hair, dark.

1226
01:50:02,817 --> 01:50:05,067
And she's buxom and strong.

1227
01:50:05,150 --> 01:50:05,984
[Paul] Yeah?

1228
01:50:08,484 --> 01:50:09,400
Christmas.

1229
01:50:10,234 --> 01:50:11,609
It's all so far away still.

1230
01:50:12,150 --> 01:50:13,900
[Kat] No, it's not. It's really close.

1231
01:50:17,734 --> 01:50:20,567
We want another child. Or children, Paul.

1232
01:50:20,650 --> 01:50:24,109
Because what is Christmas
without children? It's nothing, really.

1233
01:50:24,192 --> 01:50:25,025
Ah?

1234
01:50:26,859 --> 01:50:27,859
You know whenâ€¦

1235
01:50:28,650 --> 01:50:30,400
Once we're back home, then we willâ€¦

1236
01:50:31,109 --> 01:50:32,984
-Yeah?
-We must do something together.

1237
01:50:33,734 --> 01:50:35,775
The two of us together.
Something big, yeah?

1238
01:50:35,859 --> 01:50:36,692
Yeah, yeah.

1239
01:50:38,775 --> 01:50:39,650
What is it?

1240
01:50:40,317 --> 01:50:42,984
I'm a shoemaker, Paul. I repair shoes.

1241
01:50:43,525 --> 01:50:47,067
Ah? You know how to read, write.
You finished school.

1242
01:50:48,067 --> 01:50:49,317
Hasn't done me any good, though.

1243
01:50:50,525 --> 01:50:51,609
What are we gonna do?

1244
01:50:52,317 --> 01:50:53,734
Sole shoes together?

1245
01:50:54,484 --> 01:50:55,775
Are you trying to insult me?

1246
01:50:57,109 --> 01:50:58,817
I can't read my wife's letters even now.

1247
01:51:00,192 --> 01:51:01,484
You're going to university, Paul.

1248
01:51:02,525 --> 01:51:03,859
Or I'll shoot you right here.

1249
01:51:06,317 --> 01:51:07,442
My trousers are loose.

1250
01:51:10,317 --> 01:51:11,525
My trousers are loose.

1251
01:51:12,317 --> 01:51:13,900
[laughs]

1252
01:51:13,984 --> 01:51:15,859
[Paul] You'll just have to eat something.

1253
01:51:16,775 --> 01:51:18,984
[Kat] Soon we'll be home
then we can eat whatever we want.

1254
01:51:20,275 --> 01:51:21,150
Whatever we want.

1255
01:51:26,775 --> 01:51:28,775
[geese honking]

1256
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:47,400
It's your go.

1257
01:51:48,067 --> 01:51:50,067
If the farmer catches me again,

1258
01:51:50,150 --> 01:51:52,025
then he's bound
to shoot me down where I stand.

1259
01:51:52,109 --> 01:51:52,942
[clicks and whistles]

1260
01:51:56,442 --> 01:51:58,275
Just be careful of the damn dog too.

1261
01:51:58,359 --> 01:51:59,234
Yeah.

1262
01:52:31,275 --> 01:52:32,275
[woman] Ah?

1263
01:52:50,692 --> 01:52:52,775
Shh, shhâ€¦ Hey, hey, hey.

1264
01:52:52,859 --> 01:52:54,400
[barn door opens]

1265
01:53:13,192 --> 01:53:14,150
[in French] Look.

1266
01:53:17,192 --> 01:53:18,525
It's really good.

1267
01:53:21,900 --> 01:53:22,734
Want some?

1268
01:53:25,234 --> 01:53:26,150
[in English] Shit.

1269
01:53:49,984 --> 01:53:51,984
[calm piano music playing]

1270

-[dog barks]

1271
01:54:08,984 --> 01:54:10,984
[farmer, in French] Piece of garbageâ€¦

1272
01:54:17,192 --> 01:54:18,192
Stop!

1273
01:54:19,150 --> 01:54:20,275
Thief!

1274
01:54:28,859 --> 01:54:30,484
[in English] Kat! Run!

1275
01:54:31,359 --> 01:54:32,359
Run!

1276
01:54:34,234 --> 01:54:35,234
[in French] Asshole!

1277
01:54:40,942 --> 01:54:41,775
God damn!

1278
01:54:43,025 --> 01:54:45,025
We'll kill them, these sons of bitches.

1279
01:55:02,275 --> 01:55:03,650
[in English] Oh, crap.

1280
01:55:03,734 --> 01:55:05,150
-Look at this.
-What is it?

1281
01:55:06,109 --> 01:55:08,067
-[Paul] A lucky shot.
-He hit the eggs!

1282
01:55:09,942 --> 01:55:11,025
Stop the flow.

1283
01:55:16,484 --> 01:55:17,775
Come on, get it in there.

1284
01:55:18,859 --> 01:55:19,900
There you go.

1285
01:55:22,859 --> 01:55:24,192
We can have an omelette.

1286
01:55:24,275 --> 01:55:26,400
No, we'll eat them now.

1287
01:55:26,484 --> 01:55:27,400
They're just as good.

1288
01:55:46,317 --> 01:55:47,400
Better than ever.

1289
01:55:49,192 --> 01:55:50,109
I won't be long.

1290
01:57:20,442 --> 01:57:22,067
[gunshot sounds]

1291
01:57:27,484 --> 01:57:28,400
Kat?

1292
01:57:33,317 --> 01:57:34,484
Kat?

1293
01:57:38,859 --> 01:57:39,734
Kat!

1294
01:57:41,942 --> 01:57:42,984
What happened?

1295
01:57:43,900 --> 01:57:44,734
We should leave.

1296
01:57:46,609 --> 01:57:47,650
Who fired the shot?

1297
01:57:48,150 --> 01:57:49,525
That little shit from the farm.

1298
01:57:50,650 --> 01:57:51,817
The farmer's son.

1299
01:57:53,859 --> 01:57:55,275
-[groaning]
-Kat, Kat.

1300
01:57:56,150 --> 01:57:57,192
[Kat] What a mess.

1301
01:58:05,317 --> 01:58:06,192
How big is it?

1302
01:58:06,692 --> 01:58:08,984
[Paul] Little finger.
I'll get the bullet out.

1303
01:58:09,067 --> 01:58:11,317
No. Give me a cigarette.

1304
01:58:12,525 --> 01:58:13,692
Let the medic do that.

1305
01:58:32,109 --> 01:58:34,192
They stuck me in a class
with seven-year-olds.

1306
01:58:36,109 --> 01:58:37,734
I'd begun shaving already.

1307
01:58:39,442 --> 01:58:40,525
Find me a word.

1308
01:58:42,650 --> 01:58:44,192
That trifle can rhyme with.

1309
01:58:45,359 --> 01:58:46,192
Mhm.

1310
01:58:48,275 --> 01:58:50,567
Nothing rhymes with trifle. Nothing.

1311
01:58:57,150 --> 01:58:58,525
Fucking shit.

1312
01:58:59,942 --> 01:59:02,067
Why the hell did this have to happen now?

1313
01:59:05,900 --> 01:59:07,525
-Come on, we need to move.
-Yeah.

1314
01:59:07,609 --> 01:59:09,150
[grunting]

1315
01:59:10,067 --> 01:59:11,067
[drum beats sound]

1316
01:59:14,692 --> 01:59:15,609
[Paul] Alright?

1317
01:59:16,650 --> 01:59:17,859
Kat?

1318
01:59:17,942 --> 01:59:19,067
-[drum beats sound]
-Rifle.

1319
01:59:19,150 --> 01:59:20,317
[Kat] Mhm?

1320
01:59:20,400 --> 01:59:22,109
[Paul] Rifle rhymes with trifle.

1321
01:59:22,192 --> 01:59:24,150
[laughs]

1322
01:59:24,234 --> 01:59:26,359
[drum beats sound]

1323
01:59:29,692 --> 01:59:31,317
[drum beats sound]

1324
01:59:32,067 --> 01:59:35,775
[Paul] When we get home, you're going
to make a new pair of boots for me.

1325
01:59:35,859 --> 01:59:37,692
I'm walking my feet to the bone.

1326
01:59:38,400 --> 01:59:40,400
[distant cheering]

1327
01:59:52,275 --> 01:59:53,150
Hey!

1328
01:59:56,609 --> 01:59:57,734
Wait!

1329
01:59:57,817 --> 01:59:58,817
[horn honks]

1330
01:59:59,317 --> 02:00:00,275
Pull over!

1331
02:00:00,859 --> 02:00:01,734
Let us on!

1332
02:00:02,900 --> 02:00:04,525
Hey! Let us on!

1333
02:00:08,317 --> 02:00:09,317
[grunting]

1334
02:00:15,650 --> 02:00:16,734
Come on, will you?

1335
02:00:32,484 --> 02:00:33,650
[heavy breathing]

1336
02:00:33,734 --> 02:00:34,900
[drum beats sound]

1337
02:00:38,484 --> 02:00:39,650
[drum beats sound]

1338
02:00:43,442 --> 02:00:44,775
[drum beats sound]

1339
02:00:47,400 --> 02:00:49,400
[chattering]

1340
02:00:52,234 --> 02:00:53,359
This man needs care.

1341
02:00:55,734 --> 02:00:56,900
Where is the medic?

1342
02:00:56,984 --> 02:00:58,984
[grunting]

1343
02:01:25,984 --> 02:01:27,692
[medic] Could've spared yourself
the trouble.

1344
02:01:28,859 --> 02:01:29,692
Huh?

1345
02:01:30,734 --> 02:01:31,567
[medic] He's dead.

1346
02:01:37,150 --> 02:01:39,525
But it'sâ€¦ It's just a small bullet wound.

1347
02:01:40,150 --> 02:01:42,817
Yes, black blood. Straight into the liver.

1348
02:01:43,359 --> 02:01:44,442
The organs are poisoned.

1349
02:01:51,400 --> 02:01:52,400
Unconscious.

1350
02:01:53,525 --> 02:01:54,359
[medic] No.

1351
02:01:54,984 --> 02:01:55,942
He's dead.

1352
02:01:56,484 --> 02:01:57,609
I know what I'm doing.

1353
02:01:59,984 --> 02:02:02,775
Impossible. I wasâ€¦
I was just talking to him.

1354
02:02:03,359 --> 02:02:04,484
He's unconscious.

1355
02:02:06,359 --> 02:02:07,442
He's unconscious.

1356
02:02:14,859 --> 02:02:15,692
[medic] See?

1357
02:02:17,609 --> 02:02:20,400
He simply had bad luck.
Right before the end.

1358
02:02:21,442 --> 02:02:23,442
[medic walks away]

1359
02:02:28,734 --> 02:02:29,775
[door closes]

1360
02:02:54,359 --> 02:02:56,359

[church bells ring]

1364
02:04:09,109 --> 02:04:10,734
[sergeant] Go on, keep going!

1365
02:04:10,817 --> 02:04:12,192
Keep going!

1366
02:04:12,692 --> 02:04:14,317
Keep going, come on!

1367
02:04:22,984 --> 02:04:24,067
[soldier] This is it.

1368
02:04:26,234 --> 02:04:27,734
I'm going to tell him I'm going home.

1369
02:04:29,692 --> 02:04:30,692
It's over.

1370
02:04:32,525 --> 02:04:34,192
[sergeant] Attention!

1371
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:41,359
[general] Soldiers.

1372
02:04:41,984 --> 02:04:44,150
We stand here as brothers

1373
02:04:45,109 --> 02:04:46,817
in a world of enemies

1374
02:04:46,900 --> 02:04:49,817
and are forced to watch
as German social democrats

1375
02:04:49,900 --> 02:04:52,859
render our beloved people defenseless

1376
02:04:54,150 --> 02:04:57,067
by accepting a perfidious armistice.

1377
02:04:59,109 --> 02:05:00,025
Comrades.

1378
02:05:01,067 --> 02:05:02,900
Soon you will be going home

1379
02:05:02,984 --> 02:05:05,400
to your parents, wives and children.

1380
02:05:06,359 --> 02:05:07,525
The war is over.

1381
02:05:08,234 --> 02:05:13,067
After years of sacrifice and suffering,
you can now look forward to your reward.

1382
02:05:13,734 --> 02:05:17,900
To the reward of admiration
for all you have achieved here.

1383
02:05:19,400 --> 02:05:20,984
Ah, but comrades,

1384
02:05:22,400 --> 02:05:25,234
do you want to be welcomed
as soldiers and heroes on your return

1385
02:05:27,275 --> 02:05:28,150
or as weaklings

1386
02:05:28,234 --> 02:05:31,400
and cowards who tucked their tails in
when it really counted?

1387
02:05:31,484 --> 02:05:32,525
[soldier] We're going home.

1388
02:05:32,609 --> 02:05:33,484
[general] Soldiers.

1389
02:05:34,317 --> 02:05:38,234
We are about to attack them
with the utmost force and vehemence.

1390
02:05:38,942 --> 02:05:42,484
Latierre belongs in German hands.

1391
02:05:42,567 --> 02:05:47,525
We will seize the plains before 11:00 a.m.
and end this war with a merciless strike.

1392
02:05:47,609 --> 02:05:48,942
and make them seeâ€¦

1393
02:05:49,025 --> 02:05:49,900
[chattering]

1394
02:05:49,984 --> 02:05:51,484
â€¦we were victorious.

1395
02:05:51,567 --> 02:05:56,567
Onwards, with God on our side
as he was with our fathers before us.

1396
02:05:56,650 --> 02:05:59,317
[soldier] I'm not going back
into battle. Not me!

1397
02:05:59,400 --> 02:06:00,567
[Steinberger] Shut up!

1398
02:06:01,859 --> 02:06:04,317

-[horse neighs]
-[Steinberger] Do as your told!

1400
02:06:06,275 --> 02:06:07,359
All of you, get back.

1401
02:06:08,067 --> 02:06:10,442
-[soldier] Please, I didn't do anything!
-[Steinberger] Aim!

1402
02:06:10,525 --> 02:06:13,275

[Steinberger] Keep moving!

1406
02:06:41,650 --> 02:06:42,484
Come on!

1407
02:06:50,734 --> 02:06:52,650
Company, halt!

1408
02:06:56,942 --> 02:06:59,109
Rifle off!

1409
02:06:59,192 --> 02:07:02,359
-Fix bayonets!
-[soldier] Fix bayonets and load!

1410
02:07:13,025 --> 02:07:15,275
[watch ticking]

1411
02:07:17,400 --> 02:07:18,859
What time is it?

1412
02:07:18,942 --> 02:07:20,275
[soldier] Fifteen minutes to go.

1413
02:07:35,484 --> 02:07:37,484
[chattering in French]

1414
02:07:57,609 --> 02:07:58,984
[in French] It belonged to Lefevre.

1415
02:08:00,275 --> 02:08:02,067
Poor bastard, he saved it for the end.

1416
02:08:02,775 --> 02:08:05,067
-He won't need it anymore.
-Thank you, sir.

1417
02:08:09,359 --> 02:08:11,192
Here's to you and to Lefevre.

1418
02:08:17,525 --> 02:08:18,567
Well, it's good.

1419
02:08:22,192 --> 02:08:23,192
The nightmare is over.

1420
02:08:24,775 --> 02:08:26,775
