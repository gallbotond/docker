00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:49,321
- We will never make it!
- For God's sake!

176
00:14:49,364 --> 00:14:51,105
- What are you doing?
- [yells]

177
00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:53,499
- Are you crazy?
- [tires screeching]

178
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:55,153
[yelling]

179
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:17,044
[groans]

180
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:24,225
[engine revving]

181
00:15:41,068 --> 00:15:43,331
[thunder rumbles]

182
00:15:55,909 --> 00:15:57,432
Breakfast.

183
00:16:01,219 --> 00:16:02,350
Breakfast.

184
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,787
- I don't want anything.
- Yes, you do.

185
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:06,311
Ferruccio, breakfast.

186
00:16:10,054 --> 00:16:10,967
We could've won.

187
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,275
We could've won!

188
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:16,408
- We could've died.
- You should have died!

189
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:32,467
What is it, huh?
What's wrong?

190
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,817
We lost the race.

191
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:37,342
Everything we worked for,
it's over.

192
00:16:37,385 --> 00:16:38,952
It's not that.

193
00:16:40,301 --> 00:16:41,520
What are you afraid of?

194
00:16:41,563 --> 00:16:43,261
What?

195
00:16:43,304 --> 00:16:45,001
There's something
wrong with your ears?

196
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:48,875
Yesterday they were fine.
What are you afraid of?

197
00:16:48,918 --> 00:16:52,008
Nothing. All my fears
already came true.

198
00:16:52,835 --> 00:16:54,141
Say it.

199
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:56,752
Say it.

200
00:17:00,495 --> 00:17:02,236
I'm afraid
that I'm not good enough.

201
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:07,241
That I-I did not win the race
not because of Matteo,

202
00:17:07,285 --> 00:17:11,289
but because I did
something wrong,
and I don't know what it was.

203
00:17:12,377 --> 00:17:14,118
That's what scares me the most.

204
00:17:17,338 --> 00:17:19,340
And I don't know
what to do next.

205
00:17:20,341 --> 00:17:22,474
What if I'm a fake?

206
00:17:22,517 --> 00:17:24,867
What if I'm not
who I think I am?

207
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:27,348
What happens then?

208
00:17:27,392 --> 00:17:28,958
You're not a fake.

209
00:17:29,785 --> 00:17:31,178
I believe in you.

210
00:17:31,222 --> 00:17:34,094
I believe in every dream
you've ever had.

211
00:17:34,138 --> 00:17:37,576
And every one of them
will come true.

212
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:39,534
You just haven't found
a way yet.

213
00:17:39,578 --> 00:17:41,841
Eat.

214
00:17:47,586 --> 00:17:51,372
What about
your rowing machine idea?
That was a good one.

215
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:55,463
Nobody needs to lose weight.
All the women got skinny
during the war.

216
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:59,032
I might need one in...

217
00:17:59,075 --> 00:18:03,210
I don't know,
eight, nine months.

218
00:18:06,648 --> 00:18:09,956
I said I might need
a weight loss machine
in about nine months.

219
00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:11,958
I heard you. I was thinking.

220
00:18:12,001 --> 00:18:14,787
She's having a baby,
you fool!

221
00:18:20,836 --> 00:18:23,448
- Really?
- No, I'm joking.

222
00:18:23,491 --> 00:18:25,754
Because it's such a good time
to do that.

223
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:29,932
It's going to be alright.

224
00:18:31,673 --> 00:18:33,284
You'll be a great father.

225
00:18:37,766 --> 00:18:40,247
I think we should
call him Matteo.

226
00:18:41,379 --> 00:18:42,510
[chuckles]

227
00:18:46,949 --> 00:18:48,516
[thunder rumbles]

228
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:11,278
[phone ringing]

229
00:19:31,298 --> 00:19:32,560
Ciao, Papa.

230
00:19:54,582 --> 00:19:55,801
You're okay?

231
00:19:56,715 --> 00:19:58,064
I'm okay.

232
00:19:58,107 --> 00:19:59,500
Huh.

233
00:19:59,544 --> 00:20:00,936
Clelia?

234
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,460
Yes, everything's fine.

235
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:08,379
You want me to help?

236
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,642
You need money?

237
00:20:11,686 --> 00:20:12,731
Yes.

238
00:20:16,212 --> 00:20:17,692
I'll pay it back.

239
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,313
I don't have much.

240
00:20:31,402 --> 00:20:33,186
But I'll give you what I have.

241
00:20:38,844 --> 00:20:40,324
It's not enough, Papa.

242
00:20:41,716 --> 00:20:43,588
I have an idea.
It will be hard.

243
00:20:44,632 --> 00:20:46,504
But it will work.

244
00:20:46,547 --> 00:20:49,202
This time I know it will work.

245
00:20:49,245 --> 00:20:51,378
I promise.

246
00:20:51,422 --> 00:20:54,512
If you do this,
I'll pay it back with interest.

247
00:20:56,035 --> 00:20:57,210
Interest?

248
00:20:58,472 --> 00:20:59,517
Yes.

249
00:21:05,653 --> 00:21:07,176
[sighs]

250
00:22:07,889 --> 00:22:09,413
He mortgaged the farm?

251
00:22:12,459 --> 00:22:14,243
You asked him to do this?

252
00:22:14,287 --> 00:22:15,854
He's my father.

253
00:22:15,897 --> 00:22:19,640
He's a husband to your mother
and a father to your brothers.

254
00:22:19,684 --> 00:22:21,207
I'll pay it back.

255
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,861
That's not the point.

256
00:22:22,904 --> 00:22:25,037
It is not his to give you.

257
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,170
It is your brothers'.
It is their farm.

258
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:31,043
They worked for it.
Their whole lives
they worked for it.

259
00:22:31,086 --> 00:22:34,655
You said it yourself.
They deserve it.

260
00:22:34,699 --> 00:22:36,222
You don't believe in me?

261
00:22:36,265 --> 00:22:38,833
I believe in you, Ferruccio.

262
00:22:38,877 --> 00:22:41,401
I believe in you more than
you believe in yourself.

263
00:22:42,489 --> 00:22:44,143
But we will find another way.

264
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:48,277
This is selfish.

265
00:22:48,321 --> 00:22:51,237
You will not put the future
of your family in danger.

266
00:22:53,282 --> 00:22:55,937
They have their own dreams.

267
00:22:55,981 --> 00:22:58,070
I would never let them
lose their farm.

268
00:22:58,113 --> 00:22:59,767
Things go wrong.

269
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:02,944
No matter your intentions,
things go wrong.

270
00:23:03,902 --> 00:23:06,600
Don't do this, Ferruccio!

271
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:10,778
No good will come of it,
I can feel it.

272
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:16,175
He only gave it to you
because you asked him.

273
00:23:16,218 --> 00:23:17,742
He gave it to me
because he believes in me.

274
00:23:17,785 --> 00:23:20,484
No. Because he pities you.

275
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:26,402
Give it back.

276
00:23:30,102 --> 00:23:33,584
He won't take it back.
I know him.

277
00:23:33,627 --> 00:23:38,719
Then you go to
the bank yourself,
and deposit it in his account.

278
00:23:48,686 --> 00:23:51,515

Ferruccio! It's Vito.
Vito Rossi!

283
00:24:30,249 --> 00:24:31,598
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

284
00:24:31,642 --> 00:24:32,991
- How've you been?
- Good.

285
00:24:33,034 --> 00:24:35,210
How's your father?
Your brothers?

286
00:24:35,254 --> 00:24:36,560
Very good.
Everybody's good.

287
00:24:36,603 --> 00:24:38,518
Excellent. Have a seat.

288
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:41,695
So, what can I do for you?

289
00:24:41,739 --> 00:24:43,436
I'd like to open an account.

290
00:24:43,479 --> 00:24:44,698
Of course.

291
00:24:46,787 --> 00:24:48,572
In your name, I assume.

292
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:53,968
Ferruccio in what name
would you like the account.

293
00:24:55,666 --> 00:24:58,756
My name... Ferruccio.

294
00:24:59,757 --> 00:25:02,498
Ferruccio Lamborghini.

295
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:04,283
- Great.
- [phone continues ringing]

296
00:25:04,326 --> 00:25:05,937
Can I smoke a cigarette?

297
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,199
Of course.

298
00:25:19,124 --> 00:25:21,387
- Take that... [mutters]
- Okay.

299
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:23,476

303

Carioca.
That's what we call it.

304
00:26:06,824 --> 00:26:10,001
- Hm.
- Small enough for a farmer
to use anywhere,

305
00:26:10,044 --> 00:26:12,830
and strong enough
for any company to want.

306
00:26:12,873 --> 00:26:16,268
With this kind of power,
it will take a lot of gasoline.

307
00:26:16,311 --> 00:26:20,707
We start with the Morris
four-cylinder 1548 cc.

308
00:26:20,751 --> 00:26:24,058
Yeah, of course.
What we talked about.

309
00:26:24,102 --> 00:26:26,626
Here's what
we didn't talk about.

310
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:29,324
- Two fuel tanks?
- Yes.

311
00:26:29,368 --> 00:26:30,717
Oh, fuck.

312
00:26:31,979 --> 00:26:32,937
Listen...

313
00:26:35,069 --> 00:26:36,767
- we start on gasoline.
- Mm-hm.

314
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:39,726
But when the exhaust manifold
warms enough,

315
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:44,688
we can cut off the gasoline
and release petroleum
from this tank.

316
00:26:44,731 --> 00:26:51,390
Maybe. The coil
would have to be hot enough
to vaporize the petroleum

317
00:26:51,433 --> 00:26:53,784
before it gets into
the carburetor.

318
00:26:53,827 --> 00:26:56,177
That's why
it'll be a copper coil.

319
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:01,966
So, two types of fuel.
One cheap, one expensive.

320
00:27:02,009 --> 00:27:03,619
And a copper coil.

321
00:27:04,795 --> 00:27:06,100
Exactly.

322
00:27:07,623 --> 00:27:09,713
I don't know.
Can it work?

323
00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:12,106
Of course it can work.

324
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:15,240
- How do you know?
- We make it work.

That-that's exciting.

328
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,728
A hybrid for our Carioca.

329
00:27:24,771 --> 00:27:26,860

- Carioca.

Okay.

335
00:27:49,883 --> 00:27:51,798
So, it's for sale?

00:27:51,842 --> 00:27:53,191

00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,407
She smiled at you.

355
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:04,713
She said good morning to you.

356
00:30:04,757 --> 00:30:05,889
Go say hello.

357
00:30:06,672 --> 00:30:08,152
Why should I?

358
00:30:08,195 --> 00:30:09,631
Because you like her?

359
00:30:12,069 --> 00:30:15,072
Maybe she doesn't like me.

360
00:30:15,115 --> 00:30:17,857
You'll never know
if you don't talk to her.

361
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:19,467
It's not that hard.
You...

362
00:30:19,511 --> 00:30:24,255
You go over, you let your
mouth move and it says, "Hello."

363
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:26,779
Okay.

364
00:30:26,822 --> 00:30:27,998
Ferruccio!

365
00:30:28,041 --> 00:30:29,129
Where are you going?!

366
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:33,917
- Hi.
- Hi.

367
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,180
- Ferruccio.
- Annita. Nice to meet you.

368
00:30:38,356 --> 00:30:40,793
Okay. [laughing]

369
00:30:46,755 --> 00:30:50,063
Annita, say hello
to my friend, Matteo.

370
00:30:50,107 --> 00:30:52,587
- Hi.
- Hi.

371
00:30:56,765 --> 00:30:59,899
What he meant to say is,
"Why don't you sit down
and join us?"

372
00:30:59,943 --> 00:31:02,684
Oh, I can't,
I will be late for school.

373
00:31:05,078 --> 00:31:06,514
What-what do you study?

374
00:31:06,558 --> 00:31:08,212
- Economics.
- Oh.

375
00:31:11,824 --> 00:31:16,307
And Matteo's the greatest
race car driver
that the world has ever known.

376
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:21,094
He knows more about engines
than anyone else.

377
00:31:21,138 --> 00:31:23,053
- Really?
- No.

378
00:31:26,186 --> 00:31:27,883
Thanks for the pastry.

379
00:31:31,975 --> 00:31:33,454
[exhales]

380
00:31:35,804 --> 00:31:37,241
She likes you.

381
00:31:37,284 --> 00:31:40,157
Because I talked to her.

382
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,029
If you are as good with tractors
as you are with women,

383
00:31:43,073 --> 00:31:44,683
oh, we are going to be
very rich.

384
00:31:44,726 --> 00:31:46,990
I only need one woman.

385
00:31:47,686 --> 00:31:49,340
Yeah. Me too.

386
00:31:51,037 --> 00:31:52,212
Don't give up.

387
00:31:52,256 --> 00:31:54,475
We only lose when we give up.
Alright?

388
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:56,434
Alright, alright.

389
00:32:10,317 --> 00:32:13,059
[both laughing]

390
00:32:13,103 --> 00:32:16,932
I love you.
More than anything, I love you.

391
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:19,631
I know.

392
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:26,812
- Okay, hold it. Okay.
- Okay.

393
00:32:32,122 --> 00:32:34,907
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Okay.

394
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:36,474
- Okay?
- Yes.

395
00:32:47,572 --> 00:32:49,095
Wave, stupid.

396
00:32:54,883 --> 00:32:55,971
Okay.

397
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:00,628
Look. Look here. Look.

398
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,500
- [laughing]
- [Clelia] Really?

399
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,590
[Ferruccio] Stop, stop, stop.

400
00:33:05,633 --> 00:33:07,853
- Yes, yes.
- No, no, no.

401
00:33:07,896 --> 00:33:10,160
No, no, no! [yelping]

402
00:33:10,203 --> 00:33:11,944
- [laughing]
- My God--

406
00:33:31,181 --> 00:33:32,486
Okay.

407
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,198
He's close, isn't he?

408
00:33:49,155 --> 00:33:51,462
[Clelia] Yes. Tomorrow.

409
00:33:54,595 --> 00:33:56,249
Don't come home late.

410
00:33:58,382 --> 00:33:59,818
Okay?

411
00:33:59,861 --> 00:34:02,125
Promise me.

412
00:34:02,168 --> 00:34:03,474
I promise.

413
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,739
[spray can hissing]

414
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:01,358
[Ferruccio]
Gianni, I can't be late. Gianni.

415
00:35:23,597 --> 00:35:25,295
[line trilling]

416
00:35:25,338 --> 00:35:27,340

[people chattering]

419
00:36:09,643 --> 00:36:13,038
She was bleeding,
I called the hospital.
They took her.

00:36:19,436 --> 00:36:21,176
[man yells]

421

422
00:36:23,178 --> 00:36:25,442
- Push, Clelia. Push, Clelia.
- [grunts]

423
00:36:25,485 --> 00:36:27,357
- Okay.
- The baby's coming.

424
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,662
- He's coming.
- Again.

425
00:36:28,706 --> 00:36:30,708
[nurse] It's coming.
It's coming. Breathe.

426
00:36:30,751 --> 00:36:32,318
- Push, Clelia.
- [Clelia grunts]

427
00:36:32,362 --> 00:36:35,278
Good. Breathe and push.

428
00:36:37,976 --> 00:36:39,586
- Push.
- [grunts]

429
00:36:41,893 --> 00:36:43,982
She's getting the paper!
She's bleeding!

430
00:36:44,025 --> 00:36:45,288
Forceps!

431
00:36:45,331 --> 00:36:51,294
Ferruccio! Ferruccio!

434
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:07,135
Can I help you?

435
00:37:07,788 --> 00:37:09,181
My wife is here!

[baby crying]

437
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:33,205
How is Clelia?

438
00:37:33,248 --> 00:37:36,164
The baby is fine.
It's a beautiful boy.

439
00:37:36,208 --> 00:37:37,644
Where is my wife?

440
00:37:39,167 --> 00:37:40,517
There was a problem.

441
00:37:51,571 --> 00:37:53,530
We weren't able
to stop the bleeding.

442
00:38:07,457 --> 00:38:09,676

[baby crying]

452
00:39:44,118 --> 00:39:47,687
We need to set a date
for the baby, for the baptism.

453
00:39:47,731 --> 00:39:49,341
Yes.

454
00:39:49,384 --> 00:39:51,386
You need to think about
other things now.

455
00:39:53,476 --> 00:39:54,520
[Ferruccio] Of course.

456
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:59,612
May the seeds of the fruit
be planted with goodwill.

457
00:39:59,656 --> 00:40:01,962
And the harvest will be rich.

458
00:40:12,364 --> 00:40:13,800
- [Vito] Ferruccio.
- Vito.

459
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:17,543
So sorry about your wife.

460
00:40:17,587 --> 00:40:19,937
I have a proposition for you.

461
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:25,029
If I built a tractor
half that size

462
00:40:25,072 --> 00:40:27,901
but twice as strong,
and half the cost to operate,

463
00:40:27,945 --> 00:40:30,861
would your bank invest
in a thousand of them?

464
00:40:34,952 --> 00:40:36,649
Have you built such a tractor?

465
00:41:07,854 --> 00:41:09,160
[chuckles]

466
00:41:12,598 --> 00:41:14,382

[jazzy music playing]

468
00:41:24,784 --> 00:41:27,831
To the future
of the Lamborghini tractor.

469
00:41:27,874 --> 00:41:30,137
- We did it.
- We did it.

470
00:41:30,181 --> 00:41:31,225
[glasses clink]

471
00:41:37,362 --> 00:41:39,103
She should be here with us.

472
00:41:40,626 --> 00:41:43,368
- To Clelia.
- To Clelia.

473
00:41:47,677 --> 00:41:48,678
Look who's here.

474
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:58,557
I'm crazy about her, Ferruccio.

475
00:41:58,601 --> 00:42:01,429
I see her face
when I close my eyes to sleep,

476
00:42:01,473 --> 00:42:03,649
and it's there
when I open them to wake.

477
00:42:04,476 --> 00:42:05,999
You're in love.

478
00:42:06,043 --> 00:42:07,740
[soft chuckle] I'm in love.

479
00:42:07,784 --> 00:42:12,179
Go get her.
Tomorrow it may be too late.

480
00:42:19,404 --> 00:42:20,492
I have to go.

481
00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:24,191
Go? Where are you going?

482
00:42:24,235 --> 00:42:25,366
I'm sorry.

483
00:42:27,717 --> 00:42:30,241
- Talk to her.
- Yeah.

484
00:42:40,468 --> 00:42:41,469
[door opens]

485
00:42:41,513 --> 00:42:43,080
[crickets chirping]

486
00:43:02,926 --> 00:43:04,710
Did my friend talk to you?

487
00:43:04,754 --> 00:43:05,798
He did.

488
00:43:06,886 --> 00:43:08,583
He doesn't catch my eye.

489
00:43:09,715 --> 00:43:10,847
You do.

490
00:43:11,674 --> 00:43:12,936
But you know that.

491
00:43:12,979 --> 00:43:15,329
Give him a chance.

492
00:43:15,373 --> 00:43:17,070
Why should I do that?

493
00:43:18,463 --> 00:43:20,378
Because he deserves one.

494
00:43:20,421 --> 00:43:21,945
So do I.

495
00:43:27,907 --> 00:43:29,300
My wife died.

496
00:43:30,257 --> 00:43:33,521
I know. What was her name?

497
00:43:34,435 --> 00:43:35,698
Clelia.

498
00:43:36,916 --> 00:43:38,004
She was beautiful.

499
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:39,919
She was everything.

500
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:44,010
Don't sit.

501
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:47,231
If you do, I will let you.

502
00:43:47,274 --> 00:43:49,755
Here's what will happen:

503
00:43:49,799 --> 00:43:53,237
I'll only take
what you have to give me
because I need it.

504
00:43:55,282 --> 00:43:57,502
And some day
you will hate me for it.

505
00:43:58,982 --> 00:43:59,896
No.

506
00:44:02,855 --> 00:44:05,858
I won't. Never.

507
00:44:09,296 --> 00:44:10,602
[door opens]

508
00:44:40,414 --> 00:44:42,199
You just want more.

509
00:44:43,287 --> 00:44:45,680
You always want more.

510
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:47,508
You want me to say I'm sorry?

511
00:44:47,552 --> 00:44:49,684
I'm sorry.

512
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:52,035
Where is your shame, Ferruccio?

513
00:44:55,865 --> 00:44:57,692
I wanted to say it's Clelia,

514
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:59,564
that her death has changed you,

515
00:44:59,607 --> 00:45:02,262
but in my heart
I know that is not true.

516
00:45:02,306 --> 00:45:05,004
This is who you are.
Who you've always been.

517
00:45:05,048 --> 00:45:06,832
Tonino needs a mother.

518
00:45:06,876 --> 00:45:08,747
So, yes,
I took her because I could.

519
00:45:08,791 --> 00:45:11,184
Think about what I just said
Matteo, because I could.

520
00:45:11,228 --> 00:45:13,447
If I didn't take her,
someone else would have.

521
00:45:13,491 --> 00:45:16,711
I'm sorry, but she was never
going to be yours.

522
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:20,150
How can I hurt my friend
by taking something
that he never had?

523
00:45:21,455 --> 00:45:22,500
[chuckles]

524
00:45:24,371 --> 00:45:26,069
Don't let this change things,
Matteo.

525
00:45:29,507 --> 00:45:30,508
I need you.

526
00:45:31,639 --> 00:45:33,641
I've always needed you.

527
00:45:33,685 --> 00:45:35,513
Clelia knew that.

528
00:45:35,556 --> 00:45:37,558
Clelia was the smart one.

529
00:45:39,386 --> 00:45:42,302
She said nothing good
could come of this,

530
00:45:43,129 --> 00:45:44,609
and look what happened.

531
00:45:50,093 --> 00:45:52,965
I want 25 percent
of the company.

532
00:45:54,749 --> 00:45:56,316
The rest is yours.

533
00:46:17,772 --> 00:46:19,949
[jazzy music playing]

534
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,178

535
00:46:39,185 --> 00:46:40,360
<i>Due cornetti.</i>

536
00:46:42,449 --> 00:46:45,409
One Sacher torte,
in its own box.

537
00:46:47,672 --> 00:46:49,152
Thank you.

538
00:46:49,195 --> 00:46:52,633
[jazzy music continues]

539
00:47:03,209 --> 00:47:04,123
Ciao Bella.

540
00:47:17,658 --> 00:47:20,139
- Is Annita in the office?
- She is.

541
00:47:21,575 --> 00:47:23,186
- Red or blue?
- Red.

542
00:47:23,229 --> 00:47:27,407
- Not blue?
- Definitely red.
Definitely red.

543
00:47:27,451 --> 00:47:29,105
Who screwed up?

544
00:47:29,148 --> 00:47:31,237
It wasn't us.

545
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:32,978
[Annita] Ferruccio!

546
00:47:37,113 --> 00:47:38,549
Go see what she wants.

547
00:47:38,592 --> 00:47:39,724
Not me.

548
00:47:39,767 --> 00:47:40,986
You're a coward.

549
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:41,944
[muttering]

550
00:47:41,987 --> 00:47:43,510
[speaking Italian]

551
00:47:50,648 --> 00:47:52,345
You look beautiful this morning.

552
00:47:52,389 --> 00:47:54,478
I'm sorry I had to leave early.

553
00:47:54,521 --> 00:47:57,002
Did I mention you
look beautiful this morning?

554
00:47:58,699 --> 00:48:00,005
[chuckles]

555
00:48:00,049 --> 00:48:03,574
Every time you buy pastries
it costs us money.

556
00:48:03,617 --> 00:48:05,097
Well, take it from my salary.

557
00:48:05,141 --> 00:48:07,491
You forget, I own the company.

558
00:48:07,534 --> 00:48:08,709
Is that so?

559
00:48:09,797 --> 00:48:12,148
Mrs. Giambini called.

560
00:48:12,191 --> 00:48:14,541
Who's-who's Giambini?

561
00:48:14,585 --> 00:48:15,978
She isn't happy
with her tractor?

562
00:48:16,021 --> 00:48:18,893
[chuckles]
No, she is unhappy with Tonino.

563
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:21,070
She's his teacher.

564
00:48:21,113 --> 00:48:23,463
Tesoro, you have to spend
more time with him.

565
00:48:23,507 --> 00:48:24,856
I give him everything.

566
00:48:24,899 --> 00:48:27,598
Yes, you give him money,
clothes, cars.

567
00:48:27,641 --> 00:48:29,643
But of yourself?

568
00:48:29,687 --> 00:48:32,516
That's what he really wants.

569
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:35,519
You know he is as smart
as you are, but he's failing.

570
00:48:35,562 --> 00:48:37,782
I'll talk to him.

571
00:48:37,825 --> 00:48:40,611
My friend Diego
has a new exhibit.

572
00:48:40,654 --> 00:48:43,483
- I hate your friend Diego.
- [chuckles]

573
00:48:43,527 --> 00:48:45,572
We should go, bring Tonino.

574
00:48:45,616 --> 00:48:48,010
Spend some time together
as a family.

575
00:48:56,844 --> 00:48:57,976
[groans]

576
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,326
Goddamn clutch!

577
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:03,416
[groans]
Tonino, it never works.

578
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,509
What do you think?

579
00:49:09,553 --> 00:49:10,858
About what?

580
00:49:11,859 --> 00:49:12,730
The boat.

581
00:49:12,773 --> 00:49:14,949
It's a present for you.

582
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:17,126
Because I failed
all my subjects?

583
00:49:18,257 --> 00:49:20,172
- Yes.
- What happens next?

584
00:49:20,216 --> 00:49:23,219
We get in the boat,
you take me out to sea,
and throw me overboard?

585
00:49:26,135 --> 00:49:28,180
Come. Sit.

586
00:49:29,834 --> 00:49:30,704
Sit.

587
00:49:37,146 --> 00:49:39,539
Tonino, life is short.

588
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:43,065
When one is young,
when one is beautiful,
like yourself,

589
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:46,068
there are more important
things than grades.

590
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:48,592
Like my mother?

591
00:49:50,985 --> 00:49:52,422
Like her.

592
00:49:52,465 --> 00:49:54,641
You still miss her, don't you?

593
00:49:56,165 --> 00:49:57,296
Yes.

594
00:49:58,645 --> 00:50:00,908
Why?

595
00:50:00,952 --> 00:50:03,259
Because she was beautiful,
like you.

596
00:50:03,302 --> 00:50:05,826
Is that why you
miss her so much?

597
00:50:15,793 --> 00:50:18,056
I miss her so much
because she was the kindest

598
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:21,190
and the smartest person
I ever met.

599
00:50:22,713 --> 00:50:24,106
She understood
better than anyone

600
00:50:24,149 --> 00:50:27,152
the difference between
right and wrong.

601
00:50:27,196 --> 00:50:29,328
And for a lot of people
that's not so easy.

602
00:50:30,764 --> 00:50:32,244
She always did the right thing.

603
00:50:33,506 --> 00:50:35,204
She made it look easy.

604
00:50:38,163 --> 00:50:40,557
Annita's pretty great, too.

605
00:50:43,168 --> 00:50:44,256
She is.

606
00:50:49,218 --> 00:50:51,524
If your grades don't improve,
I'll buy you a Ferrari.

607
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,398
[upbeat music playing]

608
00:51:09,325 --> 00:51:10,761
Good day, mate.

609
00:51:10,804 --> 00:51:12,284
I'm looking for a job.

610
00:51:12,328 --> 00:51:14,112
Any inkling
on who I might see?

611
00:51:14,156 --> 00:51:18,334
Everyone's gone home.
Come back tomorrow.

612
00:51:18,377 --> 00:51:20,988
That's a pretty flash motor
you're working on there!

613
00:51:21,032 --> 00:51:23,643
- Australian?
- Nah, Kiwi.

614
00:51:23,687 --> 00:51:27,169
- What do you do?
- Anything needed for a car.

615
00:51:27,212 --> 00:51:31,085
I came here to turn a wrench.
I love the Italian motors, mate.

616
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:33,262
Yeah, called in on Maserati,
Fiat, Ferrari,

617
00:51:33,305 --> 00:51:35,133
they all told me to piss off.

618
00:51:35,177 --> 00:51:36,395
What are we working on?

619
00:51:37,701 --> 00:51:38,876
Bad clutch.

620
00:51:48,712 --> 00:51:51,932
Whoever's been driving that car
needs a lesson or three.

621
00:51:51,976 --> 00:51:54,935
It's not the driver.
It's the clutch.

622
00:51:54,979 --> 00:51:56,981
Would that be
a matter of opinion?

623
00:51:59,766 --> 00:52:01,507
I want to modify
the tractor clutch,

624
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:03,466
to use in the Ferrari.

625
00:52:03,509 --> 00:52:07,470
In your opinion,
what do I have to do?

626
00:52:07,513 --> 00:52:10,299
The disc and the plates
are pretty much the same.

627
00:52:11,604 --> 00:52:14,259
More than enough space
to mount it.

628
00:52:14,303 --> 00:52:16,000
I'd say you don't have to do
a bloody thing,

629
00:52:16,043 --> 00:52:17,393
you just put
the new clutch in.

630
00:52:17,436 --> 00:52:20,874
- I agree.
- I'll give a hand.

631
00:52:21,701 --> 00:52:22,963
What's your name?

632
00:52:23,007 --> 00:52:25,705
Wallace.
Bob Wallace. Yours?

633
00:52:25,749 --> 00:52:28,578
Ferruccio Lamborghini.

634
00:52:32,016 --> 00:52:34,061
You have a-a car?

635
00:52:34,105 --> 00:52:35,193
Yeah.

636
00:52:35,976 --> 00:52:37,021
You a good driver?

637
00:52:37,064 --> 00:52:38,152
Yeah, I'm the best
in New Zealand.

638
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:40,372
Oh. What about Italy?

639
00:52:40,416 --> 00:52:42,461
If that was a job offer,
I'll take it.

640
00:52:42,505 --> 00:52:43,810
[chuckles]

641
00:52:46,639 --> 00:52:47,727
Come.

642
00:52:56,214 --> 00:53:00,218
I think everything
that they said is good to do.
It's good.

643
00:53:00,262 --> 00:53:03,743
Can you tell him?
Give him my very best.

644
00:53:03,787 --> 00:53:05,310
[Ferruccio]
Signor Ferrari.

645
00:53:05,354 --> 00:53:08,879
Just a moment.
Good night.

646
00:53:08,922 --> 00:53:11,229
Forgive me,
if I could have a moment.

647
00:53:11,273 --> 00:53:13,318
Ferruccio Lamborghini.
How do you do, sir?

648
00:53:14,276 --> 00:53:15,538
What can I do for you?

649
00:53:15,581 --> 00:53:17,496
If I may, in my opinion,

650
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:19,324
- you make the best cars
in the world.
- Oh.

651
00:53:19,368 --> 00:53:23,110
I have seven of them.
One for every day of the week.

652
00:53:23,154 --> 00:53:25,330
Well, there should be
more days in the week.

653
00:53:25,374 --> 00:53:27,941
More buyers like yourself.
Nice to meet you.

654
00:53:27,985 --> 00:53:32,337
I have a 250 GT Coupé,
a Pininfarina.

655
00:53:32,381 --> 00:53:34,208
I have a 250 GT Bayoneta.

656
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:36,559
- It's a great car.
I like it very much.
- Mm-hm.

657
00:53:36,602 --> 00:53:40,345
- I even bought a 250
- GT 2+2.
All great.

658
00:53:40,389 --> 00:53:44,436
But with all my Ferraris,
there is a problem.

659
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,309
The clutch.
They're all bad.

660
00:53:50,964 --> 00:53:54,228
Ferruccio Lamborghini.
You know who I am?

661
00:53:54,751 --> 00:53:55,752
Oh, yes.

662
00:53:55,795 --> 00:53:57,667
You make tractors.

663
00:53:57,710 --> 00:53:59,451
And air conditioning
and heating.

664
00:53:59,495 --> 00:54:03,020
Ah.
I've got a dinner appointment.

665
00:54:03,063 --> 00:54:06,502
Forgive me, but your clutch
does not live up to your car.

666
00:54:08,068 --> 00:54:09,896
I come as a friend.

667
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:12,986
I'm sure you know this,
I'm not the first
to point it out.

668
00:54:14,379 --> 00:54:15,815
I have a solution.

669
00:54:15,859 --> 00:54:17,556
If you'd consider a partnership.

670
00:54:18,427 --> 00:54:21,734
Ferrari and Lamborghini.

671
00:54:21,778 --> 00:54:23,867
We'll make the best cars
in the world.

672
00:54:25,608 --> 00:54:27,871
Go back to your tractors,
farmer.

673
00:54:34,181 --> 00:54:36,532
You're stealing from people.

674
00:54:36,575 --> 00:54:38,708
You're charging ten times
what it costs me

675
00:54:38,751 --> 00:54:40,536
to put a better clutch
in my tractors.

676
00:54:40,579 --> 00:54:42,625
You know what they say
about Lamborghini?

677
00:54:44,017 --> 00:54:46,716
That he's too uneducated
to understand

678
00:54:46,759 --> 00:54:47,978
what he doesn't know.

679
00:54:58,771 --> 00:55:01,905
So, not to state the obvious,
but he's a prick
of the first order.

680
00:55:01,948 --> 00:55:03,210
Isn't he?

681
00:55:03,254 --> 00:55:04,777
I don't like the way
the man talks,

682
00:55:04,821 --> 00:55:06,039
don't like the way he dresses,

683
00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:09,652
don't like his smile,
or lack thereof.

684
00:55:09,695 --> 00:55:11,393
You already have the job.

685
00:55:12,872 --> 00:55:15,005
It doesn't change the truth
of what is.

686
00:55:25,102 --> 00:55:27,191
[engine revving]

687
00:55:51,302 --> 00:55:54,261
[man] The Miura is the fiercest
and most cunning of all bulls.

688
00:55:54,305 --> 00:55:56,699
But this matador
is the champion.

689
00:55:58,004 --> 00:55:59,571
Life and death, Tonino.

690
00:55:59,615 --> 00:56:01,704
This is what bullfighting
is all about.

691
00:56:07,492 --> 00:56:11,844
Some people turn away,
others watch and learn.

692
00:56:11,888 --> 00:56:14,281
I want the bull to win.

693
00:56:14,325 --> 00:56:16,327
Me too.
But it doesn't happen often.

694
00:56:18,851 --> 00:56:22,551
Tonino, look at the faces
of the people.

695
00:56:22,594 --> 00:56:26,076
The matador kills the beast,
or the beast kills the matador.

696
00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:29,296
That moment will live forever
in the hearts of the people
watching.

697
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:31,473
Why doesn't he run away?

698
00:56:31,516 --> 00:56:33,997
Because he is a champion.

699
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:39,437
It's fascinating, isn't it?

700
00:56:39,481 --> 00:56:43,572
The bull is everything.
So unforgettable.

701
00:56:44,921 --> 00:56:46,357
[Annita] What are you thinking?

702
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,403
I'm thinking of a car.

703
00:56:51,188 --> 00:56:52,929
A car that doesn't exist yet.

704
00:56:52,972 --> 00:56:54,321
One that is as
strong and powerful

705
00:56:54,365 --> 00:56:56,236
and as unforgettable
as the bull.

706
00:56:59,413 --> 00:57:01,067
I'm going to build it.

707
00:57:02,155 --> 00:57:03,505
A car?

708
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:13,079
[woman]
Coffee, gentlemen?

709
00:57:13,123 --> 00:57:15,168
[man] Hi. Yes, please.

710
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:19,782
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

711
00:57:24,787 --> 00:57:26,745
I come get you later.

712
00:57:27,877 --> 00:57:30,880
Perfect. Have a good day.

713
00:57:34,013 --> 00:57:38,757
So, this is my idea.
How long will it take?

714
00:57:38,801 --> 00:57:41,368
How long? It can't be done.

715
00:57:43,936 --> 00:57:46,417
How long do you
think it will take?

716
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:49,246
As much as I hate to agree
with Mr. Bizzarrini,
I think he's right.

717
00:57:51,944 --> 00:57:53,772
This? This can't be done.

718
00:57:54,773 --> 00:57:55,948
You agree?

719
00:57:57,167 --> 00:57:59,038
I actually love
what you're asking.

720
00:57:59,082 --> 00:58:01,345
It's new and I'll design it.

721
00:58:03,434 --> 00:58:05,175
But engineering
is their department,

722
00:58:05,218 --> 00:58:07,394
if they think it's impossible,
who am I to argue?

723
00:58:07,438 --> 00:58:09,614
What I can say,
I can't design a car

724
00:58:09,658 --> 00:58:11,398
if I don't know
the specifications,

725
00:58:11,442 --> 00:58:12,878
and it's something
that needs to be decided.

726
00:58:12,922 --> 00:58:15,577
It is decided. It's right here.

727
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:18,536
This is the car to make
the world forget about Ferrari.

728
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:20,059
Ferruccio, please.

729
00:58:20,103 --> 00:58:22,888
A V12 touring car
double camshaft,

730
00:58:22,932 --> 00:58:25,891
dry sump lubrication,
five speed transmission.

731
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:29,286
A limited slip differential,
two ignition coils
instead of one?

732
00:58:29,329 --> 00:58:31,331
Six twin-choke carburetors.

733
00:58:31,375 --> 00:58:34,813
It's impossible to fit all
of this in a 3.5 liter engine.

734
00:58:34,857 --> 00:58:37,468
No, it must be a 3.5,
four liter is too heavy.

735
00:58:37,511 --> 00:58:40,602
We need the power
but we need the speed, too.

736
00:58:40,645 --> 00:58:43,866
The Lamborghini 350 GT has to be
as fast as a racing car.

737
00:58:43,909 --> 00:58:46,390
The man wants to defy
the laws of physics.

738
00:58:46,433 --> 00:58:48,610
Are you listening?
Either you're a carmaker

739
00:58:48,653 --> 00:58:50,046
or you are a dreamer, Ferruccio.

740
00:58:50,089 --> 00:58:52,396
Please, we all have
families here.

741
00:58:52,439 --> 00:58:54,920
We all quit our job
to come work for you.

742
00:58:54,964 --> 00:58:57,183
We all believe in you,
we all believe in your ideas
but--

743
00:58:57,227 --> 00:59:00,709
What if instead of cast-iron
we make an aluminum engine?

744
00:59:00,752 --> 00:59:02,406
I know you are
the new genius in town,

745
00:59:02,449 --> 00:59:05,452
but people have been
trying this for years.

746
00:59:05,496 --> 00:59:07,106
Aluminum can't
withstand the heat.

747
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:10,153
What if we keep
certain parts cast-iron?

748
00:59:10,196 --> 00:59:13,460
The valves, the cylinders,
the combustion chamber.

749
00:59:13,504 --> 00:59:16,202
That's something new,
I don't know
if this would work.

750
00:59:16,246 --> 00:59:17,682
But we can try it.

751
00:59:17,726 --> 00:59:19,684
It could be as much as
half the weight of the engine.

752
00:59:19,728 --> 00:59:21,555
- At least.
- And the engine,

753
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:23,993
maybe we can change it
from dry sump to wet sump.

754
00:59:24,036 --> 00:59:26,909
I need to build a chassis
to accommodate
a double camshaft.

755
00:59:26,952 --> 00:59:28,998
- Good.
- And the carburetors?

756
00:59:29,041 --> 00:59:30,695
A rear stabilizer bow
would help.

757
00:59:30,739 --> 00:59:33,219
Great. Great.
And it has to be ready to unveil

758
00:59:33,263 --> 00:59:36,309
- in the Geneva Motor Show.
- That's very tight.

759
00:59:36,353 --> 00:59:38,485
- I think we can do it.
- It's 18 months.

760
00:59:38,529 --> 00:59:41,880
No, no. Six months.
Geneva is March 21st.

761
00:59:41,924 --> 00:59:44,187
- Geneva this year?
- Yes.

762
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:47,103
- You want to do Geneva
in six months?
- Oh, yes.

763
00:59:47,146 --> 00:59:49,496
Ferruccio, please,
you're talking like a madman,
seriously.

764
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:52,195
Why would you ask me
to design an automobile
in six months

765
00:59:52,238 --> 00:59:54,023
that doesn't yet have
an engine or a chassis?

766
00:59:54,066 --> 00:59:55,502
In six months, in Geneva,

767
00:59:55,546 --> 00:59:58,114
people will be looking for
the next Ferrari.

768
00:59:58,157 --> 01:00:00,333
What they will find
is the first Lamborghini.

769
01:00:00,377 --> 01:00:02,988
The Lamborghini 350 GT.

770
01:00:07,427 --> 01:00:08,515
Why are we here?

771
01:00:09,516 --> 01:00:10,909
Someone tell me why we're here.

772
01:00:10,953 --> 01:00:13,695
- To make a car.
- To make the best car!

773
01:00:13,738 --> 01:00:16,001
To make the greatest car
the world has ever seen.

774
01:00:16,045 --> 01:00:18,656
As strong as Hercules,
as beautiful as Sofia Loren.

775
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:20,832
It must be ready for Geneva!

776
01:00:20,876 --> 01:00:23,792
It's not impossible
until we fail.

777
01:00:23,835 --> 01:00:27,099
If we fail, we fail
searching for greatness.

778
01:00:29,623 --> 01:00:31,582
Huh?

779
01:00:31,625 --> 01:00:34,106
We need to get Bevini
and Pedrazzi for fabrication
and assembly.

780
01:00:34,150 --> 01:00:36,108
They are brilliant and fast,
and everybody wants them.

781
01:00:36,152 --> 01:00:37,719
No, we'll get it.

782
01:00:37,762 --> 01:00:39,764
We'll have no time to make
our own differential or brakes.

783
01:00:39,808 --> 01:00:41,766
- We'll have to buy those.
- Germany for differentials.

784
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:44,682
- [Dallara] Zahnradfabrik.
- [Bizzarini]
England for brakes. Girling.

785
01:00:44,726 --> 01:00:46,640
Girling will never deliver
in time for Geneva.

786
01:00:46,684 --> 01:00:47,816
Leave it to me.

787
01:00:49,731 --> 01:00:51,210
Okay? Good?

788
01:00:52,429 --> 01:00:54,561
We chase the dream? Okay?

789
01:00:54,605 --> 01:00:57,390
- You're all crazy,
you know that.
- Yes! Isn't it wonderful!

790
01:00:57,434 --> 01:00:58,652
- [laughing]
- Come on.

791
01:00:58,696 --> 01:01:00,045
- Cheers.
- [Ferruccio] Yes!

792
01:01:00,089 --> 01:01:03,919
No, no, no, no. Not two weeks!
One week.

793
01:01:03,962 --> 01:01:06,443
- I need the differential
in one week.
- <i>Grazie.</i>

794
01:01:06,486 --> 01:01:09,272
[yelling in German]

795
01:01:09,315 --> 01:01:10,621
[phone receiver slams]

796
01:01:12,449 --> 01:01:14,059
Nobody wants to do anything.

797
01:01:14,103 --> 01:01:17,671
Now I have to go Germany
and then England after that.

798
01:01:19,412 --> 01:01:22,285
I don't think it's wise
what you're doing, Ferruccio.

799
01:01:22,328 --> 01:01:24,504
You're going to suck
every penny out of the tractors,

800
01:01:24,548 --> 01:01:26,550
and if it doesn't work,
we will lose everything.

801
01:01:26,593 --> 01:01:28,639
Please. It will work.

802
01:01:28,682 --> 01:01:32,338
But what if it doesn't?
Look at what happened to Lancia.

803
01:01:32,382 --> 01:01:35,602
The unions will beat them,
and Lancia will go under.

804
01:01:35,646 --> 01:01:38,736
I take good care of my men,
they have no need to strike.

805
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:41,173
The price of petrol
keeps going up,

806
01:01:41,217 --> 01:01:44,350
and there's talk
of nationalizing
the energy industry.

807
01:01:44,394 --> 01:01:47,005
People will always
need to buy tractors.

808
01:01:47,049 --> 01:01:50,487
But luxury cars?
That is the first thing
they'll stop buying.

809
01:01:52,184 --> 01:01:55,231
Alright, well, then what about
the board of directors?

810
01:01:55,274 --> 01:01:58,364
You at least
have a responsibility
to tell them what you're doing.

811
01:01:59,452 --> 01:02:01,280
I talked to them.

812
01:02:01,324 --> 01:02:03,587
You went to the board?

813
01:02:03,630 --> 01:02:05,763
I knew you would object.

814
01:02:05,807 --> 01:02:08,026
No, you know that I am right.

815
01:02:08,070 --> 01:02:11,508
But you don't care about me,
you don't care about the board,

816
01:02:11,551 --> 01:02:14,554
you don't care about your men,
you don't even care
about your own son.

817
01:02:14,598 --> 01:02:17,122
The only thing that matters
is the great Lamborghini!

818
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:18,645
What do you want me to do?!

819
01:02:22,736 --> 01:02:24,347
You want me to be normal?

820
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:26,653
You want me to be
like everyone else?

821
01:02:26,697 --> 01:02:29,526
Living on my knees, afraid to
make the wrong decision?

822
01:02:29,569 --> 01:02:32,268
Making a fool of myself
at every turn?

823
01:02:32,311 --> 01:02:35,532
Crawling like a crab
on the floor of the ocean?

824
01:02:35,575 --> 01:02:38,013
I don't know who you
thought you married!

825
01:02:38,056 --> 01:02:41,538
I married someone
who could talk! Not only yell.

826
01:02:41,581 --> 01:02:44,019
For that I have bread,
and I have a lot.

827
01:02:49,111 --> 01:02:52,984
You have already gotten yourself
off of the ocean floor.

828
01:02:53,028 --> 01:02:55,291
What you're doing
could put you back there.

829
01:02:56,858 --> 01:02:59,861
You are the only one
who doesn't understand, Annita.

830
01:02:59,904 --> 01:03:02,689
Everyone loves me.
You are the only one.

831
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:05,040
Everyone else thinks I'm great.

832
01:03:05,083 --> 01:03:07,346
Who are all these people

833
01:03:07,390 --> 01:03:08,957
who think you're so great,
Ferruccio?

834
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:13,309
My workers. Huh?
My friends.

835
01:03:13,352 --> 01:03:15,398
They love you
because you pay them.

836
01:03:15,441 --> 01:03:18,053
Once they want
what you cannot pay

837
01:03:18,096 --> 01:03:21,186
they will strike
and you will be alone.

838
01:03:31,283 --> 01:03:32,589
What is this?

839
01:03:32,632 --> 01:03:36,462
CVs for your new secretary.

840
01:03:36,506 --> 01:03:38,595
I fired the blonde
you're fucking.

841
01:03:54,959 --> 01:03:57,048
[dramatic music playing]

842
01:04:00,443 --> 01:04:02,140
Good. Coming left. Left.

843
01:04:02,184 --> 01:04:03,794
- It's left.
- Your left.

844
01:04:03,837 --> 01:04:04,708
My left.

845
01:04:04,751 --> 01:04:06,579
- Okay?
- Okay.

846
01:04:08,712 --> 01:04:11,497
[Scaglione] I think
it's everything we talked about.

847
01:04:11,541 --> 01:04:12,977
It's a little extreme.

848
01:04:13,021 --> 01:04:14,457
I like it.

849
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:16,111
It's what you asked for.

850
01:04:17,677 --> 01:04:18,635
What is this?

851
01:04:18,678 --> 01:04:20,202
The headlights.

852
01:04:20,245 --> 01:04:22,291
They pop up
when you turn on car?

853
01:04:22,334 --> 01:04:23,596
- Yes.
- Pop up?

854
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:25,163
No, no, no, Franco.

855
01:04:25,207 --> 01:04:27,600
No, no, no. It's too complex.

856
01:04:27,644 --> 01:04:30,255
We need to make a statement,
not a question.

857
01:04:30,299 --> 01:04:33,215
The idea is
when you look at it,
there are no headlights,

858
01:04:33,258 --> 01:04:37,001
then when you turn the key,
the lids rise
and the lights come up.

859
01:04:37,045 --> 01:04:39,569
It's innovative.
Ferruccio, this is new.

860
01:04:39,612 --> 01:04:43,268
It's exciting. And you wanted it
to look like a race car.

861
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:45,792
Yes, a race car,
fast and powerful,

862
01:04:45,836 --> 01:04:47,490
but still a touring car,
gran turismo.

863
01:04:47,533 --> 01:04:51,233
And look here,
this-this bonnet is too big.

864
01:04:52,277 --> 01:04:56,064
Bonnet is perfect. Perfect.

865
01:04:56,107 --> 01:04:58,980
Franco, it looks like
a marshmallow
on top of a flounder.

866
01:05:03,897 --> 01:05:06,335
Franco. Franco.

867
01:05:21,741 --> 01:05:24,353
[indistinct chatter]

868
01:05:27,660 --> 01:05:29,532
I'm sorry
I'm not good enough for you.

869
01:05:29,575 --> 01:05:32,535
[scoffs]
Franco, I love you.

870
01:05:32,578 --> 01:05:34,493
I hate your design,
but I love you.

871
01:05:35,929 --> 01:05:38,106
All I'm asking is
that you start over.

872
01:05:39,629 --> 01:05:41,892
You ask us
to be creative, Ferruccio.

873
01:05:41,935 --> 01:05:45,591
And this is creative.
And you want me to start over.

874
01:05:48,029 --> 01:05:49,813
You can't ask me the world
and when I give it to you,

875
01:05:49,856 --> 01:05:51,815
you tell me
you want a different one.

876
01:05:51,858 --> 01:05:54,644
I've given you greatness,
Ferruccio. Greatness.

877
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:57,647
You've given me a look
at something I don't understand.

878
01:05:57,690 --> 01:06:01,172
Give me something I understand.
It's all I want.

879
01:06:02,782 --> 01:06:05,829
The world will be ready
for this one day, just not now.

880
01:06:08,788 --> 01:06:12,488
The bonnet is too big,
the grill too extreme.

881
01:06:12,531 --> 01:06:14,794
I like the headlights,
I love them!

882
01:06:14,838 --> 01:06:18,407
But not for the prototype.
Next year we do that.

883
01:06:18,450 --> 01:06:20,887
The back is too sharp,
it's too sharp.

884
01:06:20,931 --> 01:06:24,239
Less contour, more round.

885
01:06:24,282 --> 01:06:27,198
Franco. Franco, look at me.

886
01:06:28,156 --> 01:06:29,983
You are a great designer.

887
01:06:30,027 --> 01:06:31,289
Maybe the greatest.

888
01:06:32,682 --> 01:06:34,727
Give me something great.

889
01:06:39,297 --> 01:06:41,517
I don't have any more to give,
Ferruccio.

890
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:46,478
Ferruccio.

891
01:06:48,393 --> 01:06:49,612
Everything good?

892
01:06:50,961 --> 01:06:53,224
Nothing is good.

893
01:06:53,268 --> 01:06:55,835
[Dallara]
The good news is the innovations
are going to work;

894
01:06:55,879 --> 01:06:58,577
the front and rear suspension's
on independent wheels,

895
01:06:58,621 --> 01:07:00,797
with double wishbones
and stabilizer bars.

896
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:02,581
We'll have the speed
and the power.

897
01:07:05,628 --> 01:07:07,456
Carburetors are too high.

898
01:07:07,499 --> 01:07:10,676
Exactly. We won't be able
to close the hood.

899
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,678
Obviously, the measurements
were off.

900
01:07:12,722 --> 01:07:15,028
I take responsibility for it,
Ferruccio.

901
01:07:15,072 --> 01:07:18,162
But we are working too fast,
there's no time
to check anything.

902
01:07:18,206 --> 01:07:21,470
I take responsibility, not you.

903
01:07:21,513 --> 01:07:24,168
So, what do we do?

904
01:07:24,212 --> 01:07:25,952
If you want to keep
the twin-choke carburetors,

905
01:07:25,996 --> 01:07:27,737
we need to create a new design.

906
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:30,218
There's no room to lower them
or make them smaller.

907
01:07:30,261 --> 01:07:32,394
What if we make them horizontal?

908
01:07:32,437 --> 01:07:34,613
I thought of that.
There's no room.

909
01:07:34,657 --> 01:07:36,267
Then we make room.

910
01:07:38,139 --> 01:07:42,360
It's possible, but these things
take time, Ferruccio.

911
01:07:42,404 --> 01:07:45,842
I can talk to Franco,
maybe he can raise the hood,
that's an easier fix.

912
01:07:45,885 --> 01:07:50,238
What are we going to make
a hump like a camel?
No, don't think so.

913
01:07:50,281 --> 01:07:53,458
We can't redesign,
we'd have to make a new engine,
we'd never make Geneva.

914
01:07:53,502 --> 01:07:57,636
Excuse me, Ferruccio,
but wouldn't it be better
to miss it

915
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:00,639
than present a car
that doesn't deliver on
everything we want it to be?

916
01:08:06,123 --> 01:08:11,215
Make the carburetors horizontal.
You'll find a way.

917
01:08:11,259 --> 01:08:14,262
[Italian music playing]

918
01:08:22,792 --> 01:08:24,054
[door closes]

919
01:08:30,191 --> 01:08:32,062
I got a proposition
for you, mate.

920
01:08:34,804 --> 01:08:37,633
I'd like to be your test driver
for this new car of ours.

921
01:08:37,676 --> 01:08:40,462
- I need a great one.
- You're looking at him.

922
01:08:42,855 --> 01:08:44,640
Are all Australians like you?

923
01:08:44,683 --> 01:08:48,644
No, Australians would love
to be like me, a kiwi.

924
01:08:50,820 --> 01:08:52,169
[chuckles]

925
01:08:54,519 --> 01:08:57,827
Actually, all kiwis
would love to be like me, too.

926
01:08:57,870 --> 01:09:00,917
But, nah. I'm a one-off.

927
01:09:06,227 --> 01:09:08,098
Ah, she's a beaut, mate.

928
01:09:11,754 --> 01:09:13,321
[man] This is what you gave me.

929
01:09:17,368 --> 01:09:19,152
I think we're pretty close.

930
01:09:33,297 --> 01:09:36,039
I thought the gold
might be wrong at first, but...

931
01:09:36,082 --> 01:09:38,389
I'm eternally grateful, maestro.

932
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:46,876
[Ferruccio] It's going to be
the greatest car
that's ever been made.

933
01:09:46,919 --> 01:09:50,793
The Lamborghini 350 GT.
We unveil in Geneva.

934
01:09:52,273 --> 01:09:57,060
Oh, interview?
That's fantastic, tomorrow.

935
01:09:57,103 --> 01:10:00,193
Tomorrow is Christmas Eve.

936
01:10:00,237 --> 01:10:02,239
No, no, no, no.
Tomorrow works.

937
01:10:02,283 --> 01:10:07,113
That's great.
Fantastic. Ciao.

938
01:10:09,855 --> 01:10:11,074
[sighs]

939
01:10:11,117 --> 01:10:12,989
[interviewer]
Car enthusiasts all over America

940
01:10:13,032 --> 01:10:15,034
are hearing rumors
that after dominating

941
01:10:15,078 --> 01:10:17,210
in the field of tractors,
air conditioning and heating,

942
01:10:17,254 --> 01:10:20,649
Lamborghini is gonna be
the big news of the upcoming
automotive season.

943
01:10:20,692 --> 01:10:22,607
This March,
at the Geneva Motor Show,

944
01:10:22,651 --> 01:10:26,002
I will unveil the first
Lamborghini Gran Turismo
automobile.

945
01:10:26,045 --> 01:10:27,960
Ah, very exciting, of course.

946
01:10:28,004 --> 01:10:29,527
But, tell me why you think
that the world

947
01:10:29,571 --> 01:10:30,746
needs another luxury car.

948
01:10:30,789 --> 01:10:33,183
We have the Ferraris,
we have the Maseratis,

949
01:10:33,226 --> 01:10:35,577
that's nothing to say
of our friends
in England and Germany.

950
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:40,364
Yes, yes, good cars all.
Many of which I own and drive.

951
01:10:40,408 --> 01:10:42,366
But it's perfection
that I am after.

952
01:10:42,410 --> 01:10:46,283
And as great as these cars are,
I'm not convinced
they are special.

953
01:10:46,327 --> 01:10:49,634
Special is drinking
your favorite wine
for the first time.

954
01:10:49,678 --> 01:10:54,030
Special is...
losing your virginity.

955
01:10:54,073 --> 01:10:57,207
Special is that one thing
you never forget.

956
01:10:57,250 --> 01:11:00,602
This is what we bring to Geneva.

957
01:11:00,645 --> 01:11:04,432
[Scaglione] Here, here and here.

958
01:11:10,873 --> 01:11:12,135
Great?

959
01:11:14,224 --> 01:11:15,573
Great.

960
01:11:16,618 --> 01:11:17,880
[laughter]

961
01:11:17,923 --> 01:11:19,272
Beautiful.

962
01:11:19,316 --> 01:11:20,926
[man] Well done.

963
01:11:20,970 --> 01:11:22,450
[Ferruccio] Bravo, bravo.

964
01:11:22,493 --> 01:11:24,365
[dramatic music playing]

965
01:11:45,603 --> 01:11:47,170
[Dallara] We reconfigured
the exhaust pipes

966
01:11:47,213 --> 01:11:48,693
and moved them
closer to the front.

967
01:11:48,737 --> 01:11:51,348
We widened the axles
an inch on each side.

968
01:11:51,392 --> 01:11:54,482
The wheels will be
15 inches instead of 16.

969
01:11:54,525 --> 01:11:56,484
We also moved from
a standard shifter

970
01:11:56,527 --> 01:11:59,138
to a gated shifter
which gave us more room.

971
01:11:59,182 --> 01:12:02,838
- Enough?
- Theoretically.

972
01:12:02,881 --> 01:12:05,144
Okay. Let's see if it fits.

973
01:12:25,121 --> 01:12:26,383
We have a car.

974
01:12:26,427 --> 01:12:27,819
[chuckles]

975
01:12:31,127 --> 01:12:35,740
When we are a success in Geneva,
they will want to know
our next idea.

976
01:12:35,784 --> 01:12:37,481
You start thinking
about this now.

977

Excuse me?

978
01:12:39,091 --> 01:12:41,877

in the world.

go wait in the car. Please.

I've been waiting for you.

- Leave, now!

Annita, I'm showing her
my sketch.

1017
01:16:31,976 --> 01:16:36,111
You said once
that you would never love me,

1018
01:16:36,154 --> 01:16:39,244
and that I would hate you
for it in the end.

1019
01:16:39,288 --> 01:16:41,072
But you were wrong.

1020
01:16:41,116 --> 01:16:44,554
I don't hate you,
I feel sorry for you.

1021
01:16:44,597 --> 01:16:47,688
You have a hole in your heart,
and I was wrong to think

1022
01:16:47,731 --> 01:16:50,995
that I could fill it
with all the love in mine.

1023
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:54,477
But now I know,
you never want
to have it filled.

1024
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:57,001
And now, neither do I.

1025
01:16:59,351 --> 01:17:00,962
And what about Tonino?

1026
01:17:01,005 --> 01:17:03,573
- What about him?
- He is my son.

1027
01:17:03,616 --> 01:17:07,708
Are you asking me
to leave him with you?

1028
01:17:07,751 --> 01:17:10,885
And leave him without
the only mother he's ever known?

1029
01:17:10,928 --> 01:17:15,193
If that is what you're asking,
then ask.

1030
01:17:15,237 --> 01:17:16,891
If you have it in you,
then ask.

Baby steps!

1044
01:18:12,076 --> 01:18:14,470
We told him, baby steps!

1045
01:18:15,427 --> 01:18:17,386
[tires screech]

1046
01:18:17,429 --> 01:18:19,388
[engine revs]

1047
01:18:21,390 --> 01:18:23,609
[dramatic music playing]

1048
01:18:42,193 --> 01:18:43,804
It's everything we want!

1049
01:18:43,847 --> 01:18:46,589
[all cheering]

1050
01:18:53,814 --> 01:18:55,337
[laughing]

1051
01:18:57,948 --> 01:18:59,341
It should be green.

1052
01:18:59,907 --> 01:19:01,822
What?

1053
01:19:01,865 --> 01:19:03,954
- Green, should be green.
- Green?

1054
01:19:03,998 --> 01:19:06,783
But-but this or next one?

1055
01:19:06,827 --> 01:19:08,785
This, for Geneva, green.

1056
01:19:08,829 --> 01:19:10,134
- Hm?
- Okay.

1057
01:19:10,178 --> 01:19:12,267
[laughing]

1058
01:19:13,703 --> 01:19:16,140
[upbeat music playing]

1059
01:19:27,195 --> 01:19:29,588
Italy has long been
an agricultural society,

1060
01:19:29,632 --> 01:19:33,070
but post-war Italy
has given birth
to an industrial Renaissance.

1061
01:19:33,114 --> 01:19:35,333
Ever wonder how one might create
something new in a world

1062
01:19:35,377 --> 01:19:39,598
of inventive, challenging,
and innovative car manufacturers
and designers?

1063
01:19:39,642 --> 01:19:41,078
Well, I'm standing here
with somebody

1064
01:19:41,122 --> 01:19:42,993
who just might be able
to have those answers.

1065
01:19:43,037 --> 01:19:45,169
None other than
Ferruccio Lamborghini.

1066
01:19:45,213 --> 01:19:46,736
[interviewer and Ferruccio]
Ciao.

1067
01:19:46,779 --> 01:19:47,824
[interviewer] So, how does
somebody like you demonstrate

1068
01:19:47,868 --> 01:19:49,217
a clear break from tradition

1069
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:50,914
and deliver something brand new?

1070
01:19:50,958 --> 01:19:53,917
The Lamborghini GT is both
beautiful and high performing.

1071
01:19:53,961 --> 01:19:57,921
It's a touring car that is fast
and powerful as any racing car.

1072
01:19:57,965 --> 01:20:00,576
[interviewer] And, can this
new car of yours be all of that?

1073
01:20:00,619 --> 01:20:02,317
[Ferruccio] Oh, it can be
all of that and more.

1074
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:05,407
It is a thing of beauty.

1075
01:20:05,450 --> 01:20:08,105
But a thing of beauty
can only be a thing of beauty
if it's shared.

1076
01:20:08,149 --> 01:20:14,329
Ladies and gentlemen,
members of the world press,
I give you Lamborghini GT!

1077
01:20:14,372 --> 01:20:16,548
[applause]

1078
01:20:21,858 --> 01:20:24,556
My friends, my friends,
I can see in your eyes

1079
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:26,819
how you love my car
but don't be shy.

1080
01:20:26,863 --> 01:20:30,954
To drive a Lamborghini,
to own a Lamborghini,
you must not be shy.

1081
01:20:30,998 --> 01:20:33,174
Mr. Lamborghini,
I know there are many questions

1082
01:20:33,217 --> 01:20:34,566
about what's under the hood
of this car,

1083
01:20:34,610 --> 01:20:36,177
but my first question is:

1084
01:20:36,220 --> 01:20:38,701
- what is the price tag
of the Lamborghini GT?
- [chuckles]

1085
01:20:38,744 --> 01:20:41,095
- What is the price
of a beautiful woman?
- Hm.

1086
01:20:41,138 --> 01:20:44,402
A great bottle of wine?
A pasta you remember
the rest of your life?

1087
01:20:44,446 --> 01:20:47,014
These things are worth
whatever they ask you
to pay for them.

1088
01:20:47,057 --> 01:20:50,408
You buy a Ferrari
when you want to be someone.

1089
01:20:50,452 --> 01:20:53,020
You buy a Lamborghini
when you are someone.

1090
01:20:54,108 --> 01:20:55,979
Lamborghini.

1091
01:20:57,633 --> 01:20:59,635
Bravo, bravo.

1092
01:21:03,769 --> 01:21:05,684
[engine revving]

1093
01:21:21,178 --> 01:21:22,875
[tires screeching]

1094
01:21:34,452 --> 01:21:37,238
[people chanting]
<i>Strike, strike,</i>

1118
01:22:27,244 --> 01:22:28,463
[TV shuts off]

1119

[dramatic music playing]

1120
01:22:45,828 --> 01:22:49,005
Half the money from the sale
of the company will go to you.

1121
01:22:49,049 --> 01:22:50,746
The rest to my brothers.

1122
01:22:57,274 --> 01:22:59,189
I put a clause in the contract.

1123
01:22:59,233 --> 01:23:01,800
They must keep the name
Lamborghini forever.

1124
01:23:16,641 --> 01:23:18,078
How is the family?

1125
01:23:19,818 --> 01:23:20,950
Good.

1126
01:23:20,993 --> 01:23:22,212
How old?

1127
01:23:23,387 --> 01:23:26,782
Girls are three and five.

1128
01:23:26,825 --> 01:23:28,436
Ferruccio is two.

1129
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:31,395
His birthday was last Saturday.

1130
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:33,658
Two years old already.

1131
01:23:34,703 --> 01:23:36,313
I should have been there.

1132
01:23:36,357 --> 01:23:39,229
Oh, it's okay.
The gift was lovely.

1133
01:23:39,273 --> 01:23:42,928
He loves boats.
Plays with it in the tub.

1134
01:23:42,972 --> 01:23:44,278
Won't take a bath without it.

1135
01:23:44,321 --> 01:23:47,019
We call him Captain Ferruccio.

1136
01:23:47,063 --> 01:23:48,282
[laughs]

1137
01:23:54,723 --> 01:23:57,334
Have you heard?

1138
01:23:57,378 --> 01:24:00,294
They've appointed me
Cavaliere del Lavoro.

1139
01:24:00,337 --> 01:24:03,253
That's exciting.

1140
01:24:03,297 --> 01:24:06,474
Now when I talk to the president
I can use the informal "tu".

1141
01:24:10,695 --> 01:24:12,175
You've done it all.

1142
01:24:12,219 --> 01:24:14,656
Everything that
you ever wanted.

1143
01:24:18,181 --> 01:24:20,488
Was it worth it, Papa?

1144
01:24:25,710 --> 01:24:27,016
Tonino...

1145
01:24:28,235 --> 01:24:31,760
It's okay.
I should get home now.

1146
01:24:46,862 --> 01:24:48,211
Ciao, Papa.
